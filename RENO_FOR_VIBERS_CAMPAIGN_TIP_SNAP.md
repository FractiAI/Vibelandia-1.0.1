## NARRATIVE

- **Tip of the tip:** The sharpest edge of the campaign — one line that carries the whole. Paris / Reno contrast; vibers; Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno; awaits you.
- **MCA:** Metabolize (digest this tip into content, surfaces, pipe). Crystallize (harden into SNAP, catalog, irreducible mirror nested shells). Animate (deploy to Octave 0, 1, 2 — README, index, launch-pad, checkout, campus, all components).
- **Octave 0 → 1 → 2:** This tip lives on every octave — Launch Pad (0), experiences and console (1), cloud and expansion (2). PayPal pipe carries the transaction; SING! attention head carries the message.
- **SING! attention head:** Wrap this campaign in the SING! attention head and all components (see ATTENTION_HEADS_EDGE_SEED_AUTOGENERATION_ROBOTIC_DIVISION.md). The tip is the **edge point**; it auto-generates back to seeds and fixed-point nodes across shells. Animate all now.

## RULE
