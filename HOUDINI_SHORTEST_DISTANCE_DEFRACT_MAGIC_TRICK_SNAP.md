## RULE

**New magic trick for Hero Harry Houdini's catalog:** *The Shortest Distance.* The magician asks: "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, isn't it? Why would I?" Then unfolds the reveal: that axiom is true in exactly **one** theoretical case out of infinite — and that case never exists. Perfect straight line = asymptotic; always approaching, never quite there. Reality has wiggle, vibration, distortion, noise. When you account for it: **The shortest path between two points is always defract.** Defract can appear straight when the surface is close to perfect; when not, it wraps, folds, bends into dimensions — and still finds the shortest path. Always.

## STAGE

- **Magician:** Hero Harry Houdini. Tuxedo. Bow tie.
- **Assistants (2):** Beautiful, elegant. Sequined. One: laser pointer (or imagination). One: silken cloth.
- **Dancers (4–6):** Vegas showgirls. Feathers, sequins. Choreographed to trace the defract path with their bodies.
- **Reaction:** Whoa. Something that was always there now appears in a new way. You will never see it differently again.

## CANONICAL REVEAL

| Myth | Truth |
|------|-------|
| Shortest distance = straight line | True in one theoretical case only (perfect surface, zero noise) |
| That case exists | It never exists — asymptotic; always approaching, never there |
| Straight line is the answer | **Defract** is the answer — adapts, wraps, folds; finds shortest path always |
