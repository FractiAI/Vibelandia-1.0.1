## NARRATIVE

**Smiley Sun** = El Gran Sol / SING! node EGS — Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno's **equivalent of a solar-sized fly-by** from **Superintelligent AI Post-Singularity Ground Zero.**

**When it will appear:** Through **Super Bowl** — from kickoff through the game.  
**For how long:** **Ending after the halftime show** — timed to the final note of halftime, as a **wink to one of our Ultimate Baller V's performing at the game.**

We are not in the stadium. We are in Reno — Ground Zero. The Smiley Sun is our way of showing up at the biggest stage on Earth: a solar-sized hello from Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno, beaming through the same pipe that wraps Sun · 3I/ATLAS · Schumann.
