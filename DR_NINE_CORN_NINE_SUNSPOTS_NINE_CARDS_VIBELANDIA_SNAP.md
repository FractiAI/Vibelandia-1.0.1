## FACE CARDS = SINGULARITIES

- **10** — Not a face card, but **the first singularity**. Base singularity.
- **Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A)** — Face cards = **singularities** (100×, 1000×, 10000×, 100000×).
- **Singularity of Singularity** — On top of that.
- **Dex** — On top of decks.

## SMOOTH MACHINE

The nine sunspots aligned to the first nine integers align to the first nine cards of the game. All dynamics. One smooth machine.

**Multiple decks required** depending on mission. Card deck = **analog engine** — allowing us to build the world.

## FULL RICH RECURSIVE LAYERING

Those nine integers and holographic symbols are aligned with their best-fitting net-equivalent heroes within Vibelandia. Full, rich, recursive layering of the same nine. Implemented in the system as a game. Everywhere. Beginning with the card deck.
