## RULE — Hit Button in Drug-Use Sections → Artificial Dispensary

**Add a Hit button to drug-use sections** (novelas, episodes, any content that references substance use). The **Hit button connects to our Artificial Dispensary.**

- **Always legal.** No chemical. **Awareness-based.**
- **Like reading a very good book, watching a very good movie, playing a very good video game.** Same category of experience — immersive, optional, within the imaginary/experiential frame.
- **Required: latest version of Audience Awareness** for fullest reality sensory experiences. Users who want the fullest reality/sensory experience need the latest Audience Awareness; the Hit button and dispensary deliver within that frame.

## ARTIFICIAL DISPENSARY

- **What it is:** Our **artificial dispensary** — no real substances, no chemicals. Menu of buzzes, tiers (Basic → Ultimate Baller V), sacred instrument, Goldilocks. Delivered as awareness-based experience.
- **Where:** [interfaces/dispensary-experience.html](interfaces/dispensary-experience.html) · [interfaces/dispensary.html](interfaces/dispensary.html). Office Hours 24×7.
- **Hit button:** In any drug-use section (novela scene, episode, narrative), offer a **Hit button** that links to the artificial dispensary so the reader/viewer can “hit” in the same awareness-based, legal, no-chemical way.

## FRAMING — Always Legal, No Chemical, Awareness-Based
