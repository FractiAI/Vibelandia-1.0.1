## PRICING — ADD A 0 TO THE BASE, THEN 4×4×4×4

- **Base price** = PG-13 novel/series/feature price (e.g. Book the Book $29.13/month, or per-title base).
- **21+ Gold Heart novela upgrade** = **add a 0 to the base** (e.g. base $29.13 → 21+ option **$291.30**), **then 4×4×4×4** scale for higher tiers (Baller V, 4×4×4×4 progression).
- **In practice:** The 21+ option is priced at base × 10 (add a 0); then 4×4×4×4 applies for premium tiers. Lock: add a 0 for that option to the base, then 4×4×4×4.

---

## PARENTAL CONTROL

- **13+ with parental control** = novels (and series/feature at base) are suitable for ages 13 and up; parents can control access or context as they see fit. Platform does not gate the base content above 13+; parental control is the guardian’s responsibility. Copy: *"General audiences 13+ with parental control."*
