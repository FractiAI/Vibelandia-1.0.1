## PARTNER PRICING MODEL (canonical)

We price partner experiences **100% tip on top of the partner’s expenses for the whole thing.** Flights are not included. Experience **begins on landing** (e.g. Rio = begins on landing in Rio).

- **Total = partner’s expenses + 100% tip**
- **Flights = not included**
- **Starts = on landing**

We are moving in all our adventures and experiences this way with partners — Reno campus, Rio, and beyond.
