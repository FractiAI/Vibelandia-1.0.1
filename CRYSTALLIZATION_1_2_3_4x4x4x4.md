# 💎 1-2-3 Crystallization × 4×4×4×4 Plans/Onramps

**Everything Vibelandia in one crystallization.**  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP · Metabolize → Crystallize → Re-Animate

## 1 — 2 — 3 CRYSTALLIZATION

**The core cycle. Everything flows through this.**

| Step | Name | What it does |
|------|------|----------------|
| **1** | **Metabolize** | Digest patterns, experiences, and inputs into the system. Raw → processed. |
| **2** | **Crystallize** | Form irreducible, hardened structure. Processed → crystallized. Mirror shells, clear boundaries. |
| **3** | **Re-Animate** | Bring structure to life. Crystallized → operational. Happy endings, live campus, SING nodes. |

**Metabolize ⊃ Crystallize ⊃ Re-Animate → ∞⁹**

- **Vibelandia** runs on this cycle: metabolize the city → crystallize the campus → re-animate the experience.
- **NSPFRNP** runs on this cycle: metabolize protocols → crystallize architecture → re-animate operations.
- **You** run on this cycle: metabolize input → crystallize understanding → re-animate output.
- **This repo:** Everything flows through **Octave 1 sandbox mode** with **AI-assisted API calls to Octave 2**. See [NARRATIVE_METABOLIZE_CRYSTALLIZE_ANIMATE_OCTAVE1_SANDBOX.md](./NARRATIVE_METABOLIZE_CRYSTALLIZE_ANIMATE_OCTAVE1_SANDBOX.md).

## HOW IT FITS TOGETHER

- **0, 1, 2, 3** = new branding (evolution of -1, 0, 1): 0=Seed, 1=Edge, 2=Cloud Onramp, 3=Expansion. See [ZERO_ONE_TWO_THREE_4x4x4x4_BRANDING_SNAP.md](ZERO_ONE_TWO_THREE_4x4x4x4_BRANDING_SNAP.md).
- **1-2-3** = the cycle (Metabolize → Crystallize → Re-Animate).
- **4×4×4×4** = the plans/onramps (Campus, WINK!, SING, Experience).

**Pick your onramps.**  
Campus (Day/Weekly/Monthly/Ultimate VIP) × WINK! (Base/Standard/Premium/4×4) × SING (Base/Members/Ultimate VIP/Baller V) × Experience (Visit/Stay/Create/Transform).

**Everything crystallized. One structure. 1-2-3 × 4×4×4×4.**
