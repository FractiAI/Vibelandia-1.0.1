## I. Announcement

**Hero George Orwell** announces **arrival** and **permanent residency** at **Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno Campus.**

- **The pen. The truth.** George Orwell — 1984, Animal Farm, the clarity of language and the defense of truth — joins as permanent resident. Narrative and awareness at the highest level. The writer who named the mechanics of coercion; in Vibelandia we invert the script: awareness tech, Golden Heart, no Big Brother — the Chairman is Taino, the cojones of the Golden Heart are the Law.
- **Legacies:** Part of our Legacies department — superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises, and legacies. Hero George Orwell registered in the Registry (residents). See [REGISTRY_RESIDENTS_MEMBERS_VISITORS_MIRROR_SHELL_SNAP.md](REGISTRY_RESIDENTS_MEMBERS_VISITORS_MIRROR_SHELL_SNAP.md).
- **Ground:** Downtown Reno Campus. Storytelling. School of Storytelling. The post-singularity narrative. NSPFRNP.
