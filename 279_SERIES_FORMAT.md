## TOP BILLING — DO NOT BURY

**Thrilling. Satisfying. Journey.** Watching **all the big cheese shit their pants** as post-singularity reality takes firm hold following the Super Bowl. Who doesn't want to see that? This is the season. Top billing. Every highlight. Every description.

## SERIES PREMISE

**2-7-9** follows the game and back-of-the-house events throughout the **one week Champion of Champions Ring of Fire Solar Trophy** — from the Super Bowl Singularity Event 2026 through the full seven-day celebration. **Thrilling. Satisfying. Journey. Watch the big cheese shit their pants as post-singularity reality takes firm hold.** The central question: **Who picks up the $5B tab?**

Big Papi (the Architect) already said he would — to honor Benito. He's good either way. He's got the BBHE. No tension there. The question is the **winning team**: do they step up and pay? Or do they let Big Papi honor Benito? **Who got da Cojones?** The series tracks the on-field drama, the front-office negotiations, the back-of-house deals, and the celestial magic of the Starting Nine as the Ring of Fire Solar Trophy burns for one full week.

## SEASON ONE EDGE

**Thrilling. Satisfying. Journey. Watch the big cheese shit their pants.** Post-singularity reality takes firm hold. **Thank you. After a week.** The meltdown. Back room, back office, backdoor — absolute meltdown across all dimensions, all ranks. Beginning at Disney. Not stopping with Hollywood, Wall Street, anything. Each day more viral. Network execs who pooh-poohed it — landed with humiliation of **five of seven days paid by Big Papi** (celebrating halftime, not champion). Performers delivered; back office did not. As they consider taking over — **bill skyrockets $5B → $50B**. Singularity fully takes hold. **Benito's Vibelandia** — Earth Paradise, golden heart adults only, happy endings, no boom boom bang bang bad guys, reggaeton and beyond. **Squeeze Erika** (Argentina) — Doubting Thomas: *Where's the beef?* **Yeris** and **Dorila** — first two new artists. **New Fractal nucleus** — studio + franchise + legacy + cast + crew + fans + squeezes, all in one, no separation, mutual 98% flow. Five land. Infrastructure mapped. Nobody gets hurt. Vibelandia was not set up for big V's — now it is. Beginning with talent agency. See [279_SEASON_ONE_EDGE.md](279_SEASON_ONE_EDGE.md).

## DRAGON & MUSHROOM LAYER — CARB & SING

**Dragon layer = Carb (analytics)** — Always looking to see who's looking. Big farting and blinding headlighting everything and everyone so no one really sees him — except the blinding headlight. They hear him. They smell him. They feel him. Insecure. Pumped up. Bad vibe. **Wrapper.** But inside there's also a golden heart.

**Mushroom layer = Sing (SING! vibers, flowers, channelers)** — Always horny.

Include in the arc. Carb and Sing woven through the meltdown, the big cheese, the post-singularity hold. **New arrival: Her** — 1963 ragtop VW Bug, candy apple red and white, golden era relic, post-singularity.
