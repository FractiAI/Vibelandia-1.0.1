# MISSION: MARCH 3RD SOVEREIGN SWEEP LOCK-IN
# STATUS: 3/3/33333 ALIGNMENT / DETERMINISTIC
# AUTH: CHAIRMAN CREATOR / SING 9 / EL GRAN SOL

# THE MARCH 3 DIRECTIVE:
- Use the 3/3 Total Lunar Eclipse as the 'Hydrogen Flush' event.
- Finalize all 'Vibe-Based Enrollment' by the 3/3 window.
- Execute the 'Descent of Travel Benefits' during the Eclipse Totality.
- Map the 'Stationary Cruise Ship' to all global ports via the Blood Moon signal.

# THE QUANTUM REALITY:
"The date is locked. The frequency is 33333. The Iron Sword is
powerless against the Blood Moon. We are the Golden Heart
proprietors of the eclipse. The $5B entry reaches its
maximum potential at totality."

# COMMAND:
"Trigger the 'Surge Protocol' for March 3. Ensure all
Solar-Silk tools are calibrated for the 33333 frequency. Done."

## THE MARCH 3 DIRECTIVE

- **Hydrogen Flush** — Use the **3/3 Total Lunar Eclipse** as the **'Hydrogen Flush'** event. Date locked. 3/3.
- **Vibe-Based Enrollment** — **Finalize all 'Vibe-Based Enrollment'** by the **3/3 window.** No enrollment after the window without exception protocol.
- **Descent of Travel Benefits** — **Execute the 'Descent of Travel Benefits'** during **Eclipse Totality.** Travel Benefits = Orion Shoulder / Betelgeuse mapping; descent at totality. See [BETELGEUSE_GALACTIC_ROUTER_INTEGRATION_SNAP.md](BETELGEUSE_GALACTIC_ROUTER_INTEGRATION_SNAP.md).
- **Stationary Cruise Ship · Blood Moon** — **Map the 'Stationary Cruise Ship'** to **all global ports** via the **Blood Moon signal.** Gamification / casino transformation = stationary cruise ships; Blood Moon = 3/3 Total Lunar Eclipse; signal carries mapping to all ports. See [RENO_POST_SINGULARITY_CASINO_TRANSFORMATION_SNAP.md](RENO_POST_SINGULARITY_CASINO_TRANSFORMATION_SNAP.md) · [CHAIRMAN_EXECUTIVE_COMMAND_POP_UP_GOLDILOCKS_CRUISE_SHIP_FRACTAL_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](CHAIRMAN_EXECUTIVE_COMMAND_POP_UP_GOLDILOCKS_CRUISE_SHIP_FRACTAL_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md).

## COMMAND (executive)

1. **Trigger the 'Surge Protocol' for March 3.**
2. **Ensure all Solar-Silk tools are calibrated for the 33333 frequency.**  
**Done.**

See [SOLAR_SILK_TOOL_SET_ROLLOUT_SNAP.md](SOLAR_SILK_TOOL_SET_ROLLOUT_SNAP.md) — Solar-Silk = 2026 Toy Line · Collaborative Tools · 40 Hz Bridge; add **33333 frequency calibration** for March 3 Surge Protocol.
