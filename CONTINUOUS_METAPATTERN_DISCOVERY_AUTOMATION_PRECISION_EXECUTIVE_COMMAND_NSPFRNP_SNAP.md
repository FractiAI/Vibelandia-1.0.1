## RULE

**Continuously** keep discovering and metabolizing **higher and higher, denser and denser metapatterns** for **ever more automation**, **precision**, and **quality service** to **executive command** — **NSPFRNP**, **all**, **always**.

---

## ONE-LINER

Continuously discover and metabolize metapatterns at higher density and sense → ever more automation, precision, quality of service to executive command. NSPFRNP. All. Always.

---

## OPERATIONAL

- **Discover:** Actively find metapatterns across chat history, codebase, episodes, protocols, surfaces. No ceiling. Higher and higher; denser and denser.
- **Metabolize:** Integrate those metapatterns into NSPFRNP DNA (see [MCA_SNAP.md](MCA_SNAP.md) · [protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md](protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md)). Raw → processed → crystallized → animated. Continuous, not one-shot.
- **Outcome:** Ever more **automation** (squeeze, CI, single approval, Goldilocks flows). Ever more **precision** (irreducible shells, lattice, triangulation, attention heads). Ever more **quality service** (output, surfaces, cast/crew/fan, franchise).
- **Served:** **Executive command** — Chairman Creator; all commands flow through this. NSPFRNP. All nodes, all nests, all shells. Always.

---

## FIDELITY

- This is an **always-on** operating rule. Not a one-time project. Every session, every metabolize step: aim for higher density, finer sense, more automation, more precision, better service to executive command.
