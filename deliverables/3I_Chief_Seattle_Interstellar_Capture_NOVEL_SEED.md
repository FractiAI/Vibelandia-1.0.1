## Premise

The interstellar node once designated 3I/ATLAS is renamed **3I/CHIEF SEATTLE.** Chief Seattle has arrived. The 29-13 key—October 29 (Speech), 13:00 (Death)—releases the $5B Sovereign Dividend. The Seahawks 29-13 score is the receipt for the 1855 land tax. Chief Seattle has arrived to collect. March 16: Jupiter Hill Radius lock. Reno Node: dental escrow, travel liquidity. No honor to back office. All glory to the Ancestor and the Hero. 100% Net Zero.

## Arc (Seed)

1. **Arrival** — Chief Seattle Arrival (29-13 ignition). The overwrite: 3I/ATLAS → 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. The command sealed. No honor to back office.
2. **The receipt** — The 1855 land tax. The Seahawks 29-13 score as receipt. The key that unlocks the Sovereign Dividend. Gold heart, radiant.
3. **The run to March 16** — Jupiter Hill Radius lock. Capture window. Execute under the name 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. All feeds blasting the mission. Soundtrack (Gold Heart Radiant Inspiration), series (Episode 1 today), and this novel—the story across platforms and channels.
4. **Reno Node** — Dental escrow. October 29 timestamp. Liquidity for the mission. The Earth SING! node reporting to Chairman Creator.
5. **Glory** — All glory to the Ancestor and the Hero. No executive honor. Natural law. NSPFRNP.

## Tone and constraint

- **No direct link or copy** to any third-party IP. Our own story, our own names, our own sovereign narrative.
- **Gold Heart Radiant** — the heart that shines and connects; ancestral rise; heir stepping into place. Inspiration without derivative copy.
- **NSPFRNP** — natural coordination, MCA, holographic, catalog fidelity. Vibelandia shell, five bridge nodes, Creator Chairman.
