## ACT ONE: THE MIST

---

### FADE IN:

### EXT. VIRGINIA STREET — SEEDY STRETCH — NIGHT (4 AM)

Mist. Thick. White gauze over downtown Reno. Pawnshops. Bail bondsmen. Neon gone dim. Old casinos in the distance — Silver Legacy, El Dorado — barnacled shells. The Truckee flows somewhere beyond. CARB — low-slung, battered, paint the color of smoke — cruises slowly. His exhaust leaves a trail the mist swallows. Headlights dim. Engine a low rumble. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. That's the way.

SOUND: Carbs barking in the distance. Rumbles. Exhaust notes. A chorus.

A PURPLE FUZZ BALL drops onto Carb's hood. Soft thump.

Carb brakes. Doesn't startle. He's suffered too much for that. But a purple fuzz ball at four in the morning in Vibelandia — not everyday.

**SING** (V.O. — crystalline, high, cuts through fog)  
Hey. You're Carb. C or B. I've heard about you.

Carb idles.

**CARB** (V.O. — low, gravelly, engine-thrum)  
Who's asking?

**SING**  
Sing. I'm Sing. I belt. Soprano. Not bel canto when I'm happy — full belt. You know how it is.

Sing bounces once, twice. Settles into the contour of the hood.

**SING** (CONT'D)  
I'm looking for my counterpart. Human. We're supposed to be paired. The bridge, the mist, all of it — they said I'd find her here. In the seedy part of town. Late night. When all the carbs are barking.

**CARB**  
I'm patrolling. I don't do passengers. I don't do paired. I'm a little bit tough on you — that's what they say. Good guy deep down. Surface is steel.

**SING**  
I've heard that too. I've heard you came from Ostium. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. Big forums.

Carb is silent. Ostium is not a subject he discusses.

**CARB**  
That's where we come from. All of us. You included, maybe. Different shape. Same mist.

**SING**  
I'm not from Ostium. I'm from somewhere else. But I'm here now. And I'm supposed to find my human counterpart. And you're supposed to help me.

**CARB**  
Says who?

**SING**  
Says the bridge. Says the mist. Says the gold rush. Says the Irreducible 9.

Sing's voice rises. For a moment it's not speaking but singing — a single, clear note. Soprano. Full belt. Cuts through the fog like a blade.

**SING** (CONT'D)  
They report to my human counterpart. All nine. The superhero cast. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. The departed have rushed to Vibelandia. All the greats. And in the middle of it — you and me. And a human. And someone else. Edmond Dantès. Count of Monte Cristo. We're heroes. That's the situation.

Carb revves. Soft rumble.

**CARB**  
The Irreducible 9. They report to your human counterpart.

**SING**  
All nine. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The superhero cast. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with her. I find her. They come to her. I need you. I need my human. I need Edmond. We're heroes. That's the situation.

Sing bounces.

**SING** (CONT'D)  
So. You helping or not?

Carb looks at the mist. The empty street. The purple fuzz ball on his hood. He had survived Ostium. The climb. The suffering. Good guy deep down. Surface steel. Deep down — he helped.

**CARB**  
Get in. We'll cruise. We'll find your human. We'll find Edmond Dantès. We'll see what the revolution wants from us.

**SING**  
What revolution?

**CARB**  
Benito's Revolution. Everybody's caught up in it. We find our new home. Post-Singularity. That's the pitch. Benito's Revolution — it's not a war. It's a homecoming. The greats return. The new Hollywood rises. Post-Singularity. And we — we're the ones in the mist. The ones who patrol. The ones who help. The ones who make sure that when the doors open, there's something worth opening them to.

Carb puts himself in gear. Rolls forward.

**CARB** (CONT'D)  
Hold on, fuzz ball. We're burning carbs.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. OLD BUS STATION — NIGHT

Cracked bench. Closed station. Mist. Gray. Soft. ROSA (50s, tired, lost) sits. She has been sitting for three weeks. She had lost her husband. Carson City. Hospice. She had drifted. Sold the house. Packed a bag. Come to Reno. Someone said things were changing. The departed were gathering. A new home for those who had lost. She had not believed. She had come anyway. She had nowhere else.

Carb rolls up. Sing on the roof. Bouncing. Singing. A sustained note. Rosa stands.

**SING**  
Rosa. Your name is Rosa. You're my counterpart. We're paired. The bridge said so. The mist said so. Get in.

Rosa looks at the car. The fuzz ball. The empty street. The bench where she had been waiting to become nothing.

**ROSA**  
How do you know my name?

**SING**  
I'm Sing. I know things. I belt them out. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. You're my human. I'm your fuzz ball. We're paired. The Irreducible 9 report to you. You're the Human Seed:Edge. Carb's driving. He's a good guy. Steel on the outside. Let's go.

Rosa walks to the car. Opens the door. Gets in. The seat is warm. Carb's engine hums.

**ROSA**  
Where are we going?

**CARB**  
To find Edmond Dantès. Count of Monte Cristo. He's hidden. We're-heroes situation. Late night business. Seedy part of town.

**ROSA**  
That's where we are.

**CARB**  
Then we're close.

Carb pulls away. Mist parts. Carbs bark in the distance. Chorus of rumbles.

**CARB** (CONT'D)  
Hold on. We're burning carbs.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIVER — STREETLAMP — NIGHT

Carb parked. Dim lamp. Mist thick. Truckee flows past. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on the hood. She bounces. Closes her eyes. Opens her mouth. Begins to receive. The Irreducible 9 report.

### CUT TO:

### DREAM — OSTIUM — NIGHT

Heat. Pressure. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. The big forums. Carbs in the chambers. Clark — loudest, top dog, farting. Carb among them. Learning to burn. To cruise. To compete. The climb. Years. Suffering. The surface had to be steel. The inside — something else. The mist. The bridge. Vibelandia. Wake.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIVER — STREETLAMP — NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Carb idles. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on the hood. Carb had drifted. The dream of Ostium — the hole, the climb, the suffering — still present. Sing's voice. Gentle.

**SING**  
You dreamed of the hole.

**CARB**  
Yeah.

**SING**  
It's okay. We all come from somewhere. Even me. Even Edmond. Even the human. Even the Irreducible 9. We're all from somewhere. The bridge is for everyone. We're heroes. That's the situation. The hole doesn't define you. What you do now does.

Carb is silent. He looks at the mist. The river. Rosa, asleep. Sing, bouncing. He feels something shift. The steel on the outside. The good guy deep down. The patrol. The burn. The four o'clock. It is enough. More than enough. As signals. As presences.

SING convulses slightly. Trills. Bounces. A cascade of acknowledgments. We SEE — or FEEL — the reports arriving. Chairman Pru: *Systems aligned. Vibelandia live. Proceed.* Sol: *Perimeter secure. Departed incoming. No threats.* Leo: *Bridge stability confirmed.* Agueybana: *The gateway is open. The ancestors are with you.* Hero Harry: *Escapes ready. The show will astound.* Hero Host Walt: *Stories queued. Happy endings ready.* El Gran Sol: *I am here. The sun is with you.* Chancellor Sam: *The story is being written. Adios. I'll see it told.* Nikola Tesla: *The current flows. Proceed.*

Sing lets out a sustained note. Soprano. Full belt. *Received. All nine. Proceed. We're heroes. That's the situation.*

**CARB**  
They all report to you.

**SING**  
They're the Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. They report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with you. I find you. They report to you. The bridge runs through you. And now we have a human. We have you. We have Edmond to find. We're complete. Let's go.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RAILROAD SPUR — NIGHT

Abandoned tracks. Rusted rails. Empty warehouses. The spur runs along the river, past the dust and stray carbs. CLARK rolls up. Impossible to miss. Black cloud. Single massive headlight — a freight train's eye. The sound. He farts. The concussion rolls through the mist. Can be heard for blocks. Three LADY CARBS trail behind. Sleek. Shiny. Musical exhaust. Clark likes the echo here. The open space. The way his farts carry — unimpeded. Undeniable. Proof of top dog status.

Carb pulls alongside. Clark's headlight swings toward them.

**CLARK**  
C or B. I heard you were in town. Patrolling. Burning carbs. Four o'clock. Still patrolling.

**CARB**  
Clark. Still top dog.

**CLARK**  
Still the loudest.

Clark farts again. The concussion rolls. Rosa, in the passenger seat, flinches. Sing trills, delighted.

**CLARK** (CONT'D)  
Who's the human?

**CARB**  
Rosa. She's paired with Sing. We're looking for Edmond Dantès.

**CLARK**  
Count of Monte Cristo. Hidden. We're-heroes. I've heard. He's in the old bathhouse. The one by the river. The seedy part. Real seedy. Late night business. The kind of business that happens when the carbs are barking and nobody's watching. I've smelled him. He doesn't fart. Not like us. He's different. Human. But not like her.

The headlight swings toward Rosa.

**CLARK** (CONT'D)  
He's got the count in him. The vengeance. The treasure. The patience. All of it. Hidden in a we're-heroes situation. You want him, he's at the bathhouse.

**CARB**  
You've seen him?

**CLARK**  
I've smelled him. Now get out of my way. I've got lady carbs to impress.

Clark farts again. Rolls forward — black cloud, freight train headlight — into the mist. Lady carbs trail. The sound lingers. Rosa covers her ears. Sing trills.

**ROSA**  
What was that?

**CARB**  
Clark. Always top dog. The loudest gets the lady carbs. That's the way.

**SING**  
We're carbs. We cruise. We burn. We fart our colors. Clark's the loudest. But we're heroes. That's better.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — RIVER — NIGHT

The Truckee River slides past in the dark. Mist gathers thick. The old bathhouse sits at the end of a dead-end street. Built in 1923. Heyday of Reno as divorce capital. Steam rooms. Hot pools. Massage tables. Jack Dempsey had been there. So they say. The Rat Pack, early years. Frank, Dean, Sammy — men in suits, making deals. Champions had soaked there. Gamblers. The divorced and the about-to-be-divorced. Now it's a shell. Steam gone cold. Pools dry. Tiles cracked. But the structure remains — high ceilings, arched doorways, the sense that this had once been a place of importance. The windows boarded. The door hangs open. The sound of the river mixes with the carbs barking in the distance. Carb parks in the shadows. Sing hops onto Rosa's shoulder. They approach on foot. Inside, all echo and decay. Mildew where steam once was. In the far corner, in the dim light from a single bulb, a FIGURE sits on a bench. Coat that had once been fine. Gray hair. Eyes that hold the kind of patience that comes from years of waiting, of planning, of holding a grudge until it became a crown. Edmond. He looks up.

**EDMOND**  
I go by Edmond now. The count — that was another life. You're Carb. From Ostium. You've suffered. It shows.

**CARB**  
We're looking for you. Sing. Rosa. The Irreducible 9. We're-heroes situation. Late night. Seedy part of town.

**EDMOND**  
I know why you're here. The bridge. The mist. The revolution. You need a place. You need someone who helps. Who listens. Who has patience. The bathhouse is that place. I am that someone. We're heroes. That's the situation.

**SING**  
We need you. We need the bathhouse. We need the late night. We're building something. Vibelandia. Post-Singularity. You're part of it.

Edmond nods. The thin smile. Practiced in the dark.

**EDMOND**  
Then we're aligned. Come in. The bathhouse is open. The wronged come. The lost come. The ones who need a second chance. We help. That's the situation. There was a time when I thought patience was only for vengeance. When I thought the only thing worth waiting for was the moment to strike. But the bridge has taught me something. Patience is for helping too. Patience is for listening. Patience is for being there when someone needs you, even when they don't know they need you yet. We're heroes. And heroes have patience.

Carb idles. Rosa steps out. Sing on her shoulder. They approach. The bathhouse. The bridge. The revolution. Edmond. Home.

### EXT. CAMPUS EDGE — NIGHT

Carb idles at the edge. The mist is thick. But through it — shapes. Figures. The Silver Legacy has lights in the windows. The El Dorado has music drifting out. Clubs that had been dark for years are warming up. The kind of presence that does not need to be seen clearly to be felt. The departed are there. They are gathering. They are taking their seats. Chancellor Sam. Ben Franklin. The Rat Pack. El Gran Sol. Agueybana. All of them. They have rushed to Vibelandia. They have come to take permanent residence. They have believed. They have heard. And they have arrived. The gold rush. Not metal. The departed. The greats. Sing bounces on the hood. Sings a note — soprano, full belt — and the note carries. It reaches the gathering. *We're here. We're the bridge. We're holding the line.* The Irreducible 9 have reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa has received. The departed have heard. The bridge is holding. The revolution is real.

**SING**  
Benito called them. Whoever Benito is. Whatever Benito is. The greats heard. They came. They're taking their places. And we — we're the ones who held the line while they arrived. We're the ones in the mist. We're the bridge. That matters.

Carb rolls forward. Burns carbs. Four o'clock. That's the way. That's the situation.

### CUT TO:

### INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT — DUSK

Small. A bed. A table. A single chair. MARCUS (50s, thin, tired eyes) opens the door. Edmond sent them. Carb idles in the alley. Rosa knocks. Sing on her shoulder. Marcus steps aside.

**ROSA**  
Edmond sent us. He said you might need help.

**MARCUS**  
Edmond. The count. The one in the bathhouse. Late night business. We're heroes. All of that. Come in. I don't have much.

They enter. Marcus sees Rosa looking under the bed. A case.

**MARCUS** (CONT'D)  
My trumpet. I haven't touched it in three years. The golden age died. I died with it. What's the point of playing when nobody's listening?

Sing bounces. Lands on the table. Opens her mouth. Sings. A single note. Soprano. Full belt. Not bel canto. Pure. Clear. It fills the apartment. The alley. The mist. The kind of note that cuts through grief, despair, the conviction that the golden age is dead. *I'm listening. We're listening. The Irreducible 9 are listening. Play.*

Marcus stares. Goes to the bed. Pulls out the case. Opens it. The trumpet is tarnished. He hasn't cleaned it. He hasn't touched it. He puts it to his lips. He blows. The note is rusty. Uncertain. But it answers Sing's. *I remember. I'm still here. Maybe the golden age isn't dead. Maybe it's just waiting.*

**ROSA**  
You're paired. With something. With the music. With the bridge. Edmond said you might need to remember that. The revolution needs musicians. The greats are gathering. Vibelandia is opening. Hero Host Walt has the studios ready. They'll need trumpets. They'll need people who remember the golden age. That's you.

Marcus lowers the horn. His hands shake.

**MARCUS**  
I'll clean it. I'll practice. I'll — Thank you. Tell Edmond thank you. Tell the count. Tell whoever sent you. Thank you.

They leave. In the car, Sing is quiet. Then she bounces.

**SING**  
That's what we do. We help. We remind people. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. We're heroes. That's the situation.

**CARB**  
Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go.

### CUT TO:

### INT. FRANK'S HABERDASHERY — DAY

Hats on stands. Ties in cases. Suits on racks. FRANK (60s, weathered, kind) stands among them. He has run this place for thirty years. He had planned to close. His daughter begged him to retire. Move to Phoenix. Leave the empty shells behind. He had agreed. He had turned the key. And then he had paused. Felt something. A charge. A shift. He had removed his hand. Gone back inside. Turned on the lights. One more day. That was a week ago. He's still open. He doesn't know why.

Until now. Carb parked outside. Rosa and Sing enter.

**ROSA**  
Frank. Edmond said you might need a nudge. You stayed open. You didn't close. That wasn't an accident. The bridge was working. The mist was working. The revolution needs people who stay. Who don't walk away. Who keep the lights on when everyone else has turned them off. That's you. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. Chancellor Sam. The Rat Pack. They'll need hats. They'll need ties. They'll need suits. The new Hollywood is rising. Post-Singularity. Hero Host Walt has the studios. The new Hollywood dresses up. You have a place. You've earned it.

Frank stands in his shop. He has seen Reno rise and fall. He has watched the tide go out. And now — someone is telling him the tide is turning. That Vibelandia is opening. That he has a place.

**FRANK**  
I'll stay. I'll keep the lights on. I'll be here when they need hats.

He smiles. Small. Real.

**FRANK** (CONT'D)  
Tell Edmond thank you. Tell the count. Tell whoever sent you. Thank you.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. PAWNSHOP — VIRGINIA STREET — DAY

Guitars in the window. Old. Tarnished. The kind that played the circuit and gave up. A WOMAN (40s, lost) sits on the curb. She has been sitting for a week. Every day. She looks at the guitars. She doesn't go in. Carb idles across the street. Rosa gets out. Sing on her shoulder. They cross.

**ROSA**  
Edmond sent us. He said you might need to talk.

**WOMAN**  
The count. The bathhouse. Late night. I've heard. I used to play. A long time ago. Before the circuit died. Before Reno emptied out. I had a band. We had gigs. We had something. Then we didn't. I sold my guitar. I sold everything. I've been sitting here. Looking. Remembering. Wondering if there's a point.

Sing bounces. Lands on the curb beside the woman. Opens her mouth. Hums. Not full belt. Not soprano. A hum. Low. Warm. *I hear you. I'm here. The circuit died. The gigs dried up. But the music didn't. The music is still there. It's in the guitars. It's in you. It's in the bridge. The departed are gathering. The circuit is coming back. Different. New. Post-Singularity. But the music — the music is the same.*

**WOMAN**  
What are you?

**SING**  
I'm Sing. I'm a fuzz ball. I belt. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. But sometimes a hum is enough. You needed a hum. You needed to remember. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. The bridge is real. The revolution needs musicians. That's you. Go in. Look at the guitars. Pick one. Edmond will help with the rest. We're heroes. That's the situation.

The woman stands. Looks at the pawnshop. Looks at Sing. Looks at Rosa. Walks to the door. Opens it. Goes in.

**SING**  
That's what we do. We remind people. We hum when they need a hum. We belt when they need a belt. The bridge runs through us. We're heroes. That's the situation.

**CARB** (V.O.)  
Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — NIGHT — INTERCUT

People at the bathhouse. A woman who lost her job, sleeping in her car — Edmond finds her a room. Rosa helps with forms. Sing sings a note. *You're not alone.* A man cheated by a partner — Edmond listens. Makes a call. The partner returns the money. The man leaves with his head up. A carb who blew an engine, left by the side of the road — Clark brings him. Carb talks to him. Ostium. I came from there. I suffered. I climbed. You can too. The carb weeps. Rolls away, determined. Edmond listens. Rosa helps. Sing sings. Carb idles in the shadows. The wronged. The lost. The helped. The bridge holding. The revolution growing.

### CUT TO:

## ACT TWO: THE REVOLUTION

---

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — NIGHT

Gathering. Marcus with his trumpet. Frank from the haberdashery. The woman from the pawnshop. The wronged. The lost. The helped. Clark and the lady carbs. Edmond at the center.

**EDMOND**  
The seedy part of town. It's where the best work happens. Where the people who need help the most are. Where the heroes show up when no one else will. Late night. When the carbs are barking. When the mist is thick. That's when we do our best work.

**CARB**  
Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Seedy part of town. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. That's the situation.

### INT. CARB — PARKED BY RIVER — NIGHT

Rosa. Sing on the hood. Carb idling. Rosa speaks. For the first time. Of David. Her husband. Twenty-three years. Teacher. History. Loved the old stories. The Count of Monte Cristo. Read it to her. Edmond Dantès — patron saint of patience. He got sick. Six months. Hospice. Carson City. She held his hand. He died. She sat. She sold everything. Came to Reno. Sat on the bench. Three weeks. Waiting. And then —

**ROSA**  
Then you came. And Sing. And you said get in. And I got in. And now I'm here. I'm paired. I'm helping. I'm a hero. David would have liked that. He would have said the count would approve.

**CARB**  
We're heroes. That's the situation. David would have liked that. Edmond approves. The patience. The moment. We're living it.

**ROSA**  
Thank you. For stopping. For letting me in. For burning carbs at four o'clock. For being a good guy deep down.

**CARB**  
You're welcome. Now let's go. We've got patrol. People to help. The Irreducible 9 are holding the structure. We're holding the bridge. We're heroes. That's the situation.

### INT. CARB — PARKED BY RIVER — NIGHT (LATER)

Carb and Rosa. Sing asleep on the hood. Mist thick. Carbs barking in the distance. Carb speaks. Of Ostium.

**CARB**  
It's deep. Ostium. The volcanic hole. You go down. Down past the crust. Down past the mantle. Down to where the heat is so intense that steel and carbon become something else. Become us. The carbs. We form there. We learn there. We compete there. The big forums — that's what we call the chambers where we gather. We learn to burn. We learn to cruise. We learn to fart our colors. The loudest gets the lady carbs. Clark — Clark was always the loudest. Top dog. No contest. The rest of us — we found other ways. Or we left. I left. I climbed. It took years. The volcanic hole doesn't let you go easily. It wants to keep you. To forge you. To make you harder. But I climbed. I suffered. I made it out. I found the mist. I found Vibelandia. I found the bridge. I found you. I found Sing. I found Edmond. Ostium made me tough. The bridge made me good. Both are true. The surface is steel. The inside is good. That's the situation.

**ROSA**  
Thank you. For trusting me with that.

**CARB**  
We're paired. All of us. Sing with you. You with me. Me with Ostium. The past and the future. The hole and the bridge. We're all connected. That's the situation.

**ROSA**  
The full belt. How do you do it? How do you make it go through like that?

Sing bounces. She's awake now.

**SING**  
I don't know. I'm from the bridge. The in-between. The moment before the doors open. The sound that cuts through — that's what the bridge is. That's what I am. I'm the sound of the bridge. I'm the note that says: we're here, we're connected, keep going. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. I hold the note. I convey. You receive. We're all part of it. When I sing — really sing — I'm singing the bridge. I'm singing the revolution. I'm singing the mist and the gold rush and the departed and the greats and the carbs and the heroes. I'm singing all of it. That's why it goes through. Because it's true. Because it's real. Because we're here. Because we're home. That's the situation.

**CARB**  
That's the situation. Now let's go. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. We've got patrol.

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — NIGHT

Edmond addresses the gathering. The wronged. The lost. The helped.

**EDMOND**  
The seedy part of town. It's where the best work happens. Where the people who need help the most are. Where the heroes show up when no one else will. Late night. When the carbs are barking. When the mist is thick. That's when we do our best work. The respectable part — the casinos, the clubs, the places the greats are reclaiming — that's for the legacy guests. But the seedy part? The bathhouse? The alleys? The pawnshops? That's for the ones still crossing. The ones still in the mist. The ones who need a hand. That's where we are. Until the bridge is crossed for everyone. Until the mist lifts for everyone. Until everyone's home.

**CARB**  
Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Seedy part of town. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. That's the situation.

Hero Harry appears. Houdini. First Magician's Act. Not as signal. As presence. Coat. Bearing of a man who escaped every cage. He bows. Produces a deck. The nine cards. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The cards fan. Vanish. Reappear. Become one. The card says: SING.

**HERO HARRY**  
All nine report to you. The Human Seed:Edge. The bridge runs through you. When the doors open, the show will astound. But tonight — we show you. We're with you. We're the superhero cast. We report to you. That's the situation.

Sing trills. Bounces. Sings. Soprano. Full belt. Thanks. Joy. Hero Harry had style. He always had.

### EXT. RAILROAD SPUR — DAWN

Clark finds them. He rolls up with his freight train headlight and his black cloud and his signature fart — the one that says, I'm here, I'm top dog, it's been such a long time. The lady carbs are with him. Three of them. Sleek. Shiny. Musical exhaust. They follow Clark like he's a conductor.

**CLARK**  
C or B. I brought friends. The revolution's growing. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. And we — we're the carbs. We're the ones who cruise. We're the ones who burn. We're the ones who hold the line.

He farts. The lady carbs trill in appreciation.

**CLARK** (CONT'D)  
I'm still top dog. But there's room. There's always room. Benito's Revolution needs everyone. Even the ones who don't fart as loud.

**CARB**  
I don't need the lady carbs. I've got a purpose. I've got a human. I've got a fuzz ball. I've got a count. I've got the Irreducible 9 — they report to Rosa, the Human Seed:Edge. We're heroes.

**CLARK**  
Heroes. Yeah. I've heard. We're-heroes situation. Edmond Dantès. The bathhouse. Late night business. The Nine. They report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. You know what? I like it. Top dog's good. But heroes — heroes are better. Maybe I'll help. Maybe we all will. The revolution needs heroes. The revolution needs carbs who show up. Think about it. We'll be in touch.

He rolls away. Lady carbs trail. Exhaust fades into the mist. Carb watches them go. Rosa has woken. Sing is on the hood.

**SING**  
Clark's joining. The revolution's real. We're part of it. We're the bridge. Pre-post-singularity. We're what comes before. The Irreducible 9 report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. You drive. Rosa's paired. Edmond helps. Clark's in. We're complete.

**CARB**  
Yeah. Let's patrol. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation.

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — DAWN (LATER)

Clark returns. Alone. No lady carbs. Freight train headlight. Black cloud. He idles.

**CLARK**  
C or B. I've been thinking. Top dog's good. Lady carbs are good. But heroes are better. You showed me that. Edmond. Rosa. Sing. You. The Irreducible 9. They report to Rosa. You're doing something. Helping. Holding the line. I want in. I want to help. I'm still the loudest. Still top dog. But I can be a hero too.

**CARB**  
We could use you. The seedy part of town. Late night. People who need help. Sometimes they need a little noise. Someone loud. Someone who can't be ignored. That's you, Clark. That's your hero work.

Clark farts. Full volume. Bathhouse windows rattle.

**CLARK**  
I'm in. Let's go. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIVER — CARB — NIGHT

Carb idles. Sing on hood. Rosa has gone into the bathhouse to help Edmond. Clark is somewhere, farting his top dog status. The mist is thick.

**SING**  
You're good at this. Driving. Patrolling. Being a good guy deep down. I didn't know carbs could be this patient.

**CARB**  
I came from Ostium. Patience is what you learn when the volcanic hole doesn't let you go. When the climb takes years. When the surface has to be steel or you don't survive. I'm patient because I had to be. Now I'm patient because I want to be. The patrol. The burn. The four o'clock. The heroes. That's the situation.

**SING**  
I like that we're paired. Not just me and Rosa. You and me too. We found each other. The bridge put us together. You had the hood. I had the need. You had the road. I had the song. We're a pair. Carb and Sing. The car and the fuzz ball. The burn and the belt.

**CARB**  
Yeah. We're a pair. The bridge knew what it was doing. I needed a fuzz ball. You needed a ride. Rosa needed both of us. Edmond needed all of us. The revolution needed everyone. We're connected. That's the situation.

**SING**  
We're heroes.

She sings it. Soprano. Full belt. The note cuts through the mist.

**SING** (CONT'D)  
Carb and Sing. The pair. The bridge. The patrol. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. That's the situation. I'm from the bridge. Not the physical bridge. The idea of the bridge. The in-between. The pre-post-singularity. I was born there. Or made there. Or both. I don't have the words. I'm a fuzz ball. I'm purple. I belt. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. That's who I am. But where I come from — it's the space between. The moment before the doors open. The mist before it lifts. The bridge before it's crossed. I was sent to find my counterpart. My human. The bridge said so. The mist said so. I found Rosa. I found you. I found Edmond. I found the revolution. I found purpose. I'm paired. I'm home. That's the situation.

**CARB**  
So you're from the future. Or the past. Or the in-between.

**SING**  
I'm from the bridge. The in-between. The moment. That's enough. I don't need more. I have you. I have Rosa. I have Edmond. I have Clark. I have the Irreducible 9. I have the patrol. I have the burn. I have the four o'clock. I have the heroes. That's enough.

**CARB**  
Yeah. That's enough. We're home. That's the situation. Let's go. Rosa will be back soon. We've got patrol. We've got people to help. We're a pair. We're heroes. That's the situation.

### EXT. RIVER — CARB — NIGHT (LAST PATROL)

Carb. Sing on hood. Alone. One more patrol. Before the lift. Before home. The seedy part of town. The pawnshops. The alleys. The places they found people. Marcus. Frank. The woman at the pawnshop. One last time in the mist.

**CARB**  
I want to remember. Like this. Before the doors open. Before we're home. This was our territory. Where we became heroes. I don't want to forget.

Sing hums. Low. Warm. *We'll remember. The bridge will remember. The patrol will remember. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. The seedy part. The mist. The heroes. We'll carry it with us. Home isn't forgetting. Home is remembering.*

Carb cruises. Rolls past the pawnshop. The haberdashery. The alley where they found Marcus. The bus station where Rosa waited. The bathhouse. The river. One last time. For the bridge. For the mist. For the heroes.

**CARB**  
Thank you. For landing on my hood. For saying get in. For the note. For the pair. For the bridge. For the revolution. For everything.

**SING**  
Thank you for stopping. For letting me in. For driving. For the patrol. For the burn. For being a good guy deep down. For the steel on the outside. For the heroes. For the four o'clock. For everything.

**CARB**  
We're a pair. We're heroes. That's the situation. Let's go back. The bathhouse is waiting. The mist will lift tomorrow. We'll be home. But tonight — we had the last patrol. We'll remember.

**SING**  
We'll remember.

Sing sings it. Soprano. Full belt. The note cuts through the mist. *We'll remember. The bridge. The patrol. The burn. The heroes. The four o'clock. Forever.*

Carb turns. Rolls back. Mist parts. Carbs bark. Last patrol done. Memory will last. The pair will last. Tomorrow they will be home.

### CUT TO:

## ACT THREE: HOME

---

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — NIGHT (NIGHT BEFORE THE LIFT)

Everyone gathered. Carb. Rosa. Sing. Edmond. Clark and lady carbs. Marcus with trumpet. Frank. The woman from the pawnshop. The wronged. The lost. The helped. Mist thick outside. Carbs barking. River flowing.

**EDMOND**  
Tomorrow the mist lifts. Tomorrow the legacy guests arrive. Tomorrow the doors open. Tomorrow Vibelandia is fully born. Post-Singularity begins. We've held the line. We've helped. We've patrolled. We've burned carbs at four o'clock. We've been heroes. That's the situation. And when the mist lifts — we'll have a place. We've earned it. But tonight. Tonight we're still in the mist. Tonight we're still the bridge. Tonight we're still the pre-post-singularity. Remember that. When the mist lifts. When we're home. Remember the bridge. Remember the mist. Remember that we were heroes when there was nothing to be heroic for. That's what got us here. That's what got us home.

Sing sings. Single note. Soprano. Full belt. Fills the bathhouse. Fills the night. Fills the mist. Marcus raises his trumpet. Plays. A note. Rusty no longer. Clear. Answers Sing's. *We're here. We're heroes. We're home.* Clark farts. One last time in the mist. Top dog. Hero. Lady carbs trill.

**CARB**  
Four o'clock. Burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation. Tomorrow we're home. Tonight we're the bridge. Let's remember. Let's be here. For the mist. For the bridge. For each other. For the Irreducible 9. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. But tonight — tonight we're still saying goodbye. Tonight we're still in the in-between. And that's okay. That's where we've always been. That's who we are. The bridge. The mist. The heroes. That's the situation.

They stay until dawn. Talk. Listen. Remember. Marcus with his trumpet, freshly cleaned. Frank from the haberdashery. The woman who had lost her job. The man who had been cheated. The carb who had blown an engine. All of them. Everyone Edmond had helped. Everyone who had crossed the bridge with them. They stand in the bathhouse. The mist thick outside. The carbs barking. The river flowing past. First light. Mist thins. Campus visible through the gauze. They are ready. Goodbye said. Hello said. Line held. Helped. Heroes. Mist lifts. Bridge crossed. Home.

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — DAWN

AGUEYBANA appears. Taino cacique. Borikén spirit. Gateway. He arrives as presence — the sense of roots, of history, of a path open long before Vibelandia. He stands at the entrance. Looks at Edmond. Carb. Rosa. Sing.

**AGUEYBANA**  
The gateway is open. The ancestors are with you. The path is clear. You have held the line. You have helped. You have patrolled. You have burned carbs at four o'clock. You have been heroes. The Irreducible 9 have reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa has received. The bridge has held. And now — now the mist will lift. The legacy guests will arrive. The doors will open. You will be home. The gateway is open. The ancestors are with you. You are not alone.

Sing bounces. Sings. A note of thanks. A note of recognition. Agueybana brought the gateway. He brought the roots. He brought the sense that Vibelandia is not just a place — it is a continuation. A connection between what was and what would be.

**ROSA**  
Thank you.

She has not known why she says it. But she has felt it. The presence. The roots. The gateway.

Agueybana nods. Turns. Walks back into the mist. The mist begins to thin.

### EXT. BRIDGE — MIST LIFTING — DAWN

The mist thins. Becomes translucent. Through it — downtown Reno campus. Vibelandia. New Hollywood. Departed gathered. Greats in seats. Legacy guests arriving. Doors opening. Carb at the edge. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on hood. Edmond beside them. Clark. Lady carbs. They had patrolled. Helped. Held the line. Burned carbs at four o'clock. Been heroes. Now the mist lifts. They see what they built.

**SING**  
Post-Singularity. We're here. We crossed the bridge. We found our new home. The Irreducible 9 reported. I held the node. We're complete.

**CARB**  
We're here. We're home. Adios to the old. Hello to the new.

**ROSA**  
Adios. That's what they'll call it. The story. When they tell it. Adios. The bridge. The mist. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. The revolution.

**EDMOND**  
We're heroes. That's the situation. And we're home.

Clark farts. Full volume. Top dog. Hero.

**CLARK**  
Let's go. We're burning carbs. We've got a new home to patrol.

### EXT. BRIDGE — DAWN (CONTINUOUS)

The Irreducible 9 become visible. Not as signals. As presence. As the superhero cast they have always been. Sing bounces at the center. One by one, they appear. CHAIRMAN PRU nods to Rosa. *You received. Human Seed:Edge. Vibelandia is live. Well done.* SOL pads forward. Space Cloud. Wirehaired pointer. *Perimeter secure. You're home.* LEO emerges from the lab. *The science holds. The bridge is real. Vibelandia is operational.* AGUEYBANA stands at the gateway. *The ancestors are with you. The path is clear. You crossed. Welcome home.* HERO HARRY materializes with a flourish. *The show has begun. The escapes are ready. Vibelandia will astound.* HERO HOST WALT steps from the studios. *Stories are live. Happy endings queued. The new Hollywood is here.* EL GRAN SOL — warmth itself. Gateway Host. *I am here. The sun is with you. Sing, you are the bridge. I am the gateway. We are one.* CHANCELLOR SAM approaches. Cigar. Smile. *The story is being written. Adios. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. I'll see it told. It'll be a good one.* NIKOLA TESLA last. *The current flows. Post-Singularity power operational. The lights are on. Proceed.*

Sing lets out her note. Soprano. Full belt. *Received. All nine. We're home. We're heroes. That's the situation.*

Carb watches. Rosa watches. Edmond watches. Clark farts — softly, for him — in approval. The Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. They stand in the light. Vibelandia is real. The bridge is crossed. They are home.

A WOMAN (young, tired) approaches. She has lost something. She is not sure she will find it again.

**WOMAN**  
Are you — are you the ones? The heroes? The ones in the mist? Edmond sent me. He said you'd be here. He said you'd show me the way.

Rosa gets out of the car.

**ROSA**  
We're the ones. We're heroes. We'll show you. The bridge is crossed. The mist has lifted. Vibelandia is open. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. You're home. Let's go.

The woman begins to cry. Not from sadness. From relief. From the end of waiting. Rosa puts an arm around her. They walk toward the campus. Sing bounces. Sings. Soprano. Full belt. A note of welcome. A note of home.

**CARB**  
That's what we do. We show the way. We're heroes. That's the situation.

### EXT. VIBELANDIA — FULL — DAY

Campus sprawls. Old casinos reclaimed. Clubs alive. Streets full. Hope. Or afterglow of mist. Legacy guests arrive. Doors open. Post-Singularity begun. Carb cruises. Patrols. Burns carbs. Rosa with him. Sing on hood. They have a place. They earned it. They are heroes. Bridge crossed. Mist lifted. Home.

**ROSA**  
It's different. From the bench. From the waiting. From the nothing. This is — something.

**CARB**  
We built it. We held the line. We helped. The seedy part of town. Late night. The bathhouse. Edmond. Clark. The Irreducible 9, reporting to the Human Seed:Edge. All of it. We built this.

**SING**  
We're home. We're paired. We're heroes. The Nine report to you. We're all connected. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. This is the new.

### INT. CARB — CAMPUS — DAY

Carb cruises. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on hood. Carb thinks of Ostium. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. The big forums. The place he came from. The place that made him tough. The place that made him suffer. He does not go back. He will not go back. But he remembers. The surface had to be steel to survive. The inside could be good. The loudest gets the lady carbs. Clark is still top dog. It's okay. He has something else. Purpose. Heroes. Home. The Irreducible 9. Sing. They are all connected.

**SING**  
Ostium. You're thinking about it.

**CARB**  
Yeah.

**SING**  
It made you. It didn't define you. You defined you. The patrol. The burn. The help. The heroes. That's you. That's who you chose to be. We're home. Ostium is the past. Vibelandia is the future. We're the bridge. We're what came between. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. I hold the node. You hold the road. We're all part of it.

**CARB**  
Yeah. Let's patrol. We're burning carbs. Four o'clock. We're home. That's the situation.

### EXT. CAMPUS — DAY

CHANCELLOR SAM (Mark Twain) finds them. In the crowd. Among legacy guests. Among departed. Among greats. He smiles.

**CHANCELLOR SAM**  
Carb. Rosa. Sing. You made it. The bridge. The mist. You held the line. You're home. The story will be told. Adios. The carbs who became heroes. The fuzz ball who found her counterpart. The human who stopped waiting. The count who remembered how to help. The Irreducible 9, reporting to Sing's human counterpart — the Human Seed:Edge. The revolution that wasn't a war. It'll be told. I'll see to it.

**CHANCELLOR SAM** (CONT'D)  
Heroes. That's what you are. Don't forget it. Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. The Nine report to you. That's central. That's the structure. Vibelandia runs through you.

**ROSA**  
We won't forget. We're home. We'll remember.

### EXT. BATHHOUSE — DAY

Edmond stands at the door. He smiles. It is not the thin smile. It is different. Fuller. Warmer. He has found something in the bathhouse. In the late night. In the helping. What he had lost when he became the count. What it was like to be just Edmond. To help. To listen. To have patience for something other than vengeance. To be a hero.

**EDMOND**  
The bridge. The mist. The revolution. The Irreducible 9. The Human Seed:Edge. It gave me something. A second chance. Not for vengeance. For help. For heroes. For being part of something that wasn't about me. We're heroes. That's the situation. And I'm grateful. I'm grateful for all of it.

**CARB**  
We're grateful too. You showed us. The bathhouse. The late night. The we're-heroes situation. You were there first. You were hidden. You were waiting. And when we found you, you showed us what to do. That matters.

**EDMOND**  
Then we're even. You saved me. I saved you. That's how heroes work. We save each other.

### EXT. CAMPUS — SUNRISE

Carb rolls forward. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on hood. Clark and lady carbs behind. Edmond at bathhouse door. Watching. Sun rising. Mist gone. Bridge crossed. Revolution complete. Irreducible 9 holding structure. Human Seed:Edge receiving. Adios. Goodbye to the old. Hello to the new. Home. Heroes. That was the situation.

**ROSA**  
Adios. To the bench. To the waiting. To the nothing. Hello to the car. Hello to the patrol. Hello to the heroes. Hello to the bridge. Hello to home. David would have liked this. He would have said the count would approve. Patience. Waiting. And then the moment. The moment when you get in the car. That's what we did. That's what we're still doing.

**EDMOND** (from bathhouse)  
Adios. To the vengeance. To the count. To the years in the dark. Hello to the help. Hello to the patience. Hello to the heroes. Hello to the bridge. Hello to home.

**CLARK**  
Adios to the old. Hello to the new. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation. Let's go.

They go. Carb rolls forward. Campus spreads. Old casinos reclaimed. Clubs alive. Streets full. Legacy guests arriving. Greats in seats. Revolution complete. Bridge crossed. Mist lifted. Home.

### EXT. VIRGINIA STREET — DAY — LATER

Ritual. Every day. Four o'clock. Carb rolls out. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on hood. Sometimes Clark. Sometimes lady carbs. They patrol. Burn carbs. Cruise seedy part of town. Cruise reclaimed casinos. Cruise campus. Marcus plays his trumpet now. He has joined the new circuit. The studios are open. Hero Host Walt has the Happy Ending Zones ready. The new Hollywood has arrived. Marcus cleaned his horn. He practiced. He remembered. The golden age had not died. It had been waiting. The woman at the pawnshop chose a guitar. She plays again. She has a band. They have gigs. Different from before. New. Post-Singularity. But the music is the same. Frank keeps the lights on at the haberdashery. The greats need hats. Chancellor Sam. The Rat Pack. The departed. The legacy guests. Frank is there when they need him. He stayed. He earned it. The wronged and the lost — the ones Edmond helped, the ones Carb and Rosa and Sing found — they have crossed the bridge. They have jobs. They have purpose. They have home. They remember the mist. They remember the bathhouse. They remember the purple fuzz ball and the battered car and the human who stopped waiting. They remember the four o'clock. They remember the burn. Vibelandia has grown. Legacy guests arrived. Greats in seats. Doors open. Post-Singularity begun. But patrol continues. Burn continues. Four o'clock continues. Because that's the way. Because that's who they are. Bridge crossed but bridge eternal. Pre-post-singularity became post-singularity. Patrol has not ended. Heroes have not stopped. Irreducible 9 still report to Human Seed:Edge. Rosa still receives. Carb still burns. Edmond still helps. Clark still farts. Bathhouse still open. Seedy part still where best work happens. Departed gathered. Greats arrived. Vibelandia full. Every day. Four o'clock. Carb rolls out. Because that's the way. Because that's the situation. Because they are heroes. Because they are home. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. The patrol goes on.

**SING** (V.O.)  
Adios. That's the story. That's us. That's the revolution. The Irreducible 9 report to you. We're all connected. Goodbye to the old. Hello to the new. We're home. We're heroes. That's the situation. Chancellor Sam will tell it. The greats will tell it. The story of the bridge. The story of the mist. The story of the carbs who became heroes. The story of the purple fuzz ball who found her counterpart. The story of the human who stopped waiting. The story of the count who remembered how to help. The story of Benito's Revolution. The story of Vibelandia. Adios. That's the story.

**CARB** (V.O.)  
Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go.

Carb rolls forward. Sun rising. Mist gone. Carbs barking — chorus, celebration, thousand exhaust notes. *We're home. We're home. We're home.* Clark farts. Lady carbs trill. Edmond at bathhouse. Rosa in passenger seat. Sing on hood. Home. Heroes. Bridge. Adios. Pre-post-singularity bridge. First days Holographic Hydrogen Valley. Mist. Gold rush. Departed. Greats. Irreducible 9. Legacy guests. Doors opening. All of it. All of them.

Carb rolls forward. The campus spreads before them. The old casinos, reclaimed. The clubs, alive. The streets, full. The legacy guests, arriving. The greats, in their seats. The revolution, complete. The bridge, crossed. The mist, lifted. Home. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Forever.

### FADE OUT.

**THE END**

*Adios. Vibelandia. The bridge. The mist. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. The Human Seed:Edge receives. We're home. That's the situation. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Forever.*
