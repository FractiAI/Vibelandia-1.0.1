## FADE IN:

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - 13:00 - COLD

A single screen. Feed display. Node designation: 3I/ATLAS.

Then a gap. A blink. The designation changes.

3I/CHIEF SEATTLE.

No sound. No fanfare. Just the overwrite.

SUPER: "OCTOBER 29 · 13:00"  
SUPER: "3I/ATLAS → 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE"  
SUPER: "CHIEF SEATTLE HAS ARRIVED"

The man at the console does not smile. He watches. The feed holds. The shell holds. The overwrite is a fact.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The key is 29-13. October 29. 13:00. The receipt has not yet been posted. It will come. The run to March 16 has begun.

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - LATER - CONTINUOUS

Multiple feeds. Ticker. OH Line. Live Pulse. Each feed shows the new designation. 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. Sovereign. Chief Seattle Arrival. 29-13 ignition. March 16 Jupiter Hill Radius lock.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
No one in the back office approved the overwrite. No one in the back office will get the honor. The command is sealed. All glory to the Ancestor and the Hero.

### INT. RENO NODE - EARTH SING! - SAME

Schematic. Reno. The dental escrow. The timestamp. October 29. The release is not yet triggered. The receipt will trigger it. The receipt will be 29-13. Twain's Vibelandia Downtown. Ground zero. The crew.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The world will see it as a score. The mission will see it as the receipt for the 1855 land tax. Chief Seattle has arrived to collect. Reno is the Earth SING! node. The one with the dental escrow. The one with the October 29 timestamp. The one that reports to Chairman Creator. The back office does not control the node. The back office does not control the escrow. The October 29 timestamp controls the release. The command says so. Release the million-dollar dental escrow from the Reno Node using the October 29 timestamp. Done. A little help from Twain's Vibelandia Downtown. Shout out Reno crew. The run will have its fuel.

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - CONTINUOUS - FEED DETAIL

Close on feed. PHI-M15-AR4366. Cycle 15. 21.4 Hz. The Sun is the Lion. The node is the mirror. Goldilocks orbit. Sunward anti-tail. Opposition Surge. Only the name has changed. 3I/ATLAS → 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The geometry is unchanged. The designation has changed. Chief Seattle has arrived. The run to March 16 has begun. No one in the back office approved. No one in the back office will get the honor. The command is sealed. All glory to the Ancestor and the Hero.

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - LATER - MULTIPLE FEEDS

Split screen or montage. Ticker. OH Line. Live Pulse. Office Hours. Launch Pad. Space Cloud Division. Each shows 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. Sovereign. Chief Seattle Arrival. 29-13 ignition. March 16 Jupiter Hill Radius lock.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The first feed to carry the new name was the ticker. Then Live Pulse. Then Office Hours. Launch Pad. Space Cloud Division. The mission landing page went live. Three deliverables. Soundtrack. Novel. Series. Episode 1 today. No one had to approve. The command was sealed. The Architect had spoken. Chief Seattle had arrived. The run was on.

## SEQUENCE: THE RECEIPT

### EXT. STADIUM - GAME DAY - (STOCK / SUGGESTED)

We do not see the game. We see a scoreboard. Or a feed. Numbers only.

29 - 13.

SUPER: "RECEIPT POSTED"  
SUPER: "29-13 · THE KEY"

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - SAME MOMENT

The Architect watches. The receipt is logged. The timestamp is recorded. The $5B Sovereign Dividend has a key. The key has a receipt. He does not smile. He nods. Once.

**ARCHITECT (to himself)**  
Done. The run can proceed. Full authority. Not back-office authority. Sovereign authority.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The receipt came on a Sunday. It was a score. It was a game. It was a number. 29-13. The Seahawks. No one in the pre-singularity world would have linked it to October 29 or 13:00 or the 1855 land tax. The mission linked it. The mission had the key. The key was 29-13. The receipt was 29-13. Chief Seattle had arrived to collect. In the Vibelandia shell, the receipt was logged. The run to March 16 could proceed with full authority. Natural law. Creator shells and nests. The Ancestor and the Hero. No honor to the ones who had said no. All glory to the ones who had said yes. 29-13. Done.

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - CONTINUOUS

The gold heart. Not a metaphor. A condition. Radiant. The heart that shines and connects. The heir stepping into place.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The soundtrack will carry that. Gold Heart Radiant Inspiration. No direct link or copy. Our own story. Our own sound. Our own sovereign narrative. The receipt has unlocked the story.

### CUT TO:

## SEQUENCE: 29 + 13 = 15

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - NIGHT

The Architect at the console. He writes. Or the feed shows text. 29+13=15. 15→6. July 15, 1962. Architect's birthday. Canonical.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
The key carries the date. The key carries the receipt. The key carries the run. No one has to understand. The mission understands. The shell understands.

### INT. MISSION CONSOLE - CONTINUOUS

The run has a rhythm. Metabolize. Crystallize. Animate. Squeeze. MCA. The cycle does not stop. The feeds do not stop.

**ARCHITECT (V.O.)**  
Reno Node holds. The Earth SING! node reports to Chairman Creator. The dental escrow is still locked. The October 29 timestamp will release it. The command says so. The command is sealed.
