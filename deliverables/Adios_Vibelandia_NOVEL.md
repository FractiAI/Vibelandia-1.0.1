# PART ONE: THE MIST
## Chapters 1–7

---

## Chapter 1: Vibelandia

The mist came first. It always did. A fine white gauze that hung over downtown Reno like a shroud, or a blessing, depending on how you looked at it. It rolled in from the river at dusk. It gathered in the alleys. It clung to the old casinos — the Silver Legacy, the El Dorado — those great barnacled shells of a time when Reno had been something. It hung over the pawnshops and the bail bondsmen and the all-night diners. It hung over the bus station that had closed years ago. It hung over the bathhouse by the river. It hung over the haberdasheries and the clubs and the places where the greats would one day gather. It hung over everything. And in the mist, in the first days of whatever was coming, the carbs patrolled. They had been doing it for weeks. Months, some said. Ever since the departed had begun to whisper. Ever since the bridge had started to form. Ever since Vibelandia had become a word, a promise, a place that was coming into being. The carbs did not question it. They cruised. They burned. They farted their colors. They turned to see who was showing respect. That was the way. That had always been the way. And in the mist, in the first days of whatever was coming, they patrolled. They were the bridge. They were the pre-post-singularity. They were Vibelandia.

Vibelandia — that's what they called it. Downtown Reno. The pre-post-singularity bridge. The place between. The first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley, before the legacy guests arrived, before the greats took their seats at the table. Some said the name came from the vibe — the charge, the feeling, the sense that something was shifting. Some said it came from the departed, the ones who had rushed to take permanent residence, the greats gathering. Before any of that, there was the mist, and there were the carbs.

Carb had been patrolling for three hours when the purple fuzz ball appeared. He had been burning fuel along the seedy stretch of Virginia Street where the pawnshops gave way to the old casinos, where the neon had gone dim and the sidewalks had grown slick with something that might have been rain or might have been the residue of dreams. He cruised slowly, his engine a low rumble, his exhaust leaving a trail that the mist swallowed. This was what carbs did. You cruised. You patrolled. You burned. You farted your colors and you turned to see who was showing you respect. It was four o'clock. Burning carbs. That was the way.

The purple fuzz ball landed on his hood with a soft thump.

Carb braked. He wasn't the kind to startle — he had suffered too much for that — but a purple fuzz ball on your hood at four in the morning in Vibelandia was not an everyday occurrence.

"Hey," the fuzz ball said. Its voice was high, crystalline, the kind of voice that could cut through fog. "You're Carb. C or B. I've heard about you."

Carb idled. "Who's asking?"

"Sing. I'm Sing. I belt. Soprano. Not bel canto when I'm happy — full belt. You know how it is." The fuzz ball — Sing — bounced once, twice, settling into the contour of the hood. "I'm looking for my counterpart. Human. We're supposed to be paired. The bridge, the mist, all of it — they said I'd find him here. Or her. Them. In the seedy part of town. Late night. When all the carbs are barking."

Carb let that sit. The carbs were always barking. That was the nature of things. You cruised, you burned, you farted your colors, and somewhere in the chorus of exhaust and rumble you found your place. The loudest got the lady carbs. That was the way. Clark had the market on loud — black cloud, freight train headlight, farting so hard you could hear him from the other side of the valley. It's been such a long time, Clark liked to say, and then he'd let one rip. Top dog. No contest.

"I'm patrolling," Carb said. "I don't do passengers. I don't do paired. I'm a little bit tough on you — that's what they say about me. Good guy deep down, but the surface is steel."

Sing bounced again. "I've heard that too. I've heard you came from Ostium. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. Big forums."

Carb was silent. Ostium was not a subject he discussed. The volcanic hole. Where the carbs came from. Where he had come from. Steel and carbon and smoke and the great forums where they had learned to burn, to cruise, to fart their colors and compete for the lady carbs. He had left. He had suffered. He had arrived here, in Vibelandia, in the mist, in the first days of whatever was coming.

"That's where we come from," Carb said finally. "All of us. You included, maybe. Different shape. Same mist."

"I'm not from Ostium," Sing said. "I'm from somewhere else. But I'm here now. And I'm supposed to find my human counterpart. And you're supposed to help me."

"Says who?"

"Says the bridge. Says the mist. Says the gold rush. Says the Irreducible 9." Sing's voice rose, and for a moment it was not speaking but singing — a single, clear note that cut through the fog like a blade. Soprano. Full belt. "They report to my human counterpart. All nine. The superhero cast. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. The departed have rushed to take permanent residence at Vibelandia. All the greats. And in the middle of it, in the mist, there's us. You and me. And a human. And someone else — someone hidden. Edmond Dantès. Count of Monte Cristo. We're heroes. That's the situation."

Carb revved once. A soft rumble. "The Irreducible 9. They report to your human counterpart."

"All nine. The Chairman. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The superhero cast. They report to my human counterpart — the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with her. I'm the one who finds her. They come to her. And I need you. I need my human counterpart. I need Edmond. We're heroes. That's the situation." Sing bounced. "So. You helping or not?"

Carb had heard the names. Everyone had. The nine sunspots. The first nine cards. The Vibelandia heroes. But he had not known they reported to Sing's human counterpart — the Human Seed:Edge. Sing found the human; the human received the Nine. The bridge had surprises. The mist had layers.

"I'm a little bit tough on you," Carb said. "That's what they say. Good guy deep down. Surface is steel. I came from Ostium. I suffered. I don't do passengers. I don't do paired. But —" He paused. The mist was thick. The carbs were barking somewhere in the distance. "But I've been patrolling for three hours and I haven't helped anybody. I've just burned. Just cruised. Just farted my colors. Maybe that's not enough. Maybe the bridge is telling me something. Maybe a purple fuzz ball on my hood at four in the morning is a sign."

Carb looked at the mist. He looked at the empty street. He looked at the purple fuzz ball on his hood. He had survived Ostium. He had survived the climb out of the volcanic hole. He had survived suffering. He was a good guy deep down. The surface was steel, but deep down — deep down, he helped.

"Get in," Carb said. "We'll cruise. We'll find your human. We'll find Edmond Dantès. We'll see what the revolution wants from us."

"What revolution?"

"Benito's Revolution." Carb put himself in gear. "Everybody's caught up in it. We find our new home. Post-Singularity. That's the pitch." He began to roll forward. "Hold on, fuzz ball. We're burning carbs."

## Chapter 2: The Human

Rosa had lost her husband to the old world. The world before the bridge. The world before the mist. He had died in a hospice in Carson City, holding her hand, and she had sat there until they came to take him away. After that, she had drifted. She had sold the house. She had packed a single bag. She had come to Reno because someone had told her that things were changing, that the departed were gathering, that there was a new home for those who had lost their old one. She had not believed it. She had come anyway. What else was there to do? The bus had been late. The station had been empty. She had sat on the bench and waited. For what, she did not know. For a sign. For an end. For something to change. The mist had rolled in. The days had blurred. She had counted them at first — one, two, three — and then she had stopped counting. She had watched the carbs cruise past. She had heard them farting their colors. She had wondered what it meant. She had not moved. She had nowhere to move to.

She had been sitting on a bench outside the old bus station for three weeks, though she could not have said why. The bus station had closed years ago. The bench was cracked. The mist made everything look the same — gray, soft, forgettable. But Rosa sat. She had nowhere else to go. She had come to Vibelandia because someone had told her that the departed were gathering, that the greats were taking their places, that there was a new home for those who had lost their old one. She had lost. She had lost everything. And now she sat, waiting for a sign.

The sign arrived in the form of a purple fuzz ball and a car.

Rosa had never seen a car like Carb. He was low-slung, battered, the kind of vehicle that had seen too much road and not enough repair. His paint was the color of smoke. His headlights were dim. But there was something in the way he moved — patient, deliberate, aware — that made her sit up. And the purple fuzz ball on his roof, bouncing and singing a single sustained note, made her stand.

"Rosa," the fuzz ball called. "Your name is Rosa. You're my counterpart. We're paired. The bridge said so. The mist said so. Get in."

Rosa looked at the car. She looked at the fuzz ball. She looked at the empty street, the closed bus station, the bench where she had been waiting to become nothing.

"How do you know my name?" she asked.

"I'm Sing. I know things. I belt them out. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. You're my human. I'm your fuzz ball. We're paired. It's the way of the bridge. The Irreducible 9 report to you. You're the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with you. They report to you. We're connected." Sing bounced again. "Carb's driving. He's a good guy. Steel on the outside. Let's go."

Rosa walked to the car. She had nothing. She had lost everything. She had been waiting for a sign. Perhaps this was it. Perhaps a purple fuzz ball and a battered car in the mist of Vibelandia was exactly the sign she needed.

She opened the door. She got in. The seat was warm. Carb's engine hummed.

"Where are we going?" she asked.

"To find Edmond Dantès," Carb said. His voice was low, gravelly, the sound of an engine that had run a long time. "Count of Monte Cristo. He's hidden. We're-heroes situation. Late night business. Seedy part of town."

"That's where we are," Rosa said.

"Then we're close," Carb said. He pulled away from the curb. The mist parted. The carbs were barking somewhere in the distance — a chorus of rumbles and exhaust notes, the sound of the city coming alive, or refusing to die. "Hold on. We're burning carbs."

## Chapter 3: The Irreducible 9 Report to the Human Seed:Edge

That night, parked by the river, the Irreducible 9 reported. They reported to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. Sing convened the briefing, conveyed the signals. Rosa received. The mist was thick. The Truckee flowed past. The carbs were barking somewhere in the distance — a chorus of rumbles and exhaust notes, the sound of Vibelandia at night, the sound of the bridge holding. Carb had parked under a streetlamp that had gone dim. Rosa had climbed into the back seat to give Sing space. And Sing had bounced onto the hood. She had closed her eyes — or the fuzz ball equivalent. She had opened her mouth. And she had begun to receive. Carb idled. Rosa sat in the passenger seat. The mist was thick. And one by one, the Irreducible 9 reported.

They did not arrive in bodies. They arrived as signals. As presences. As the kind of thing that happens in Vibelandia when the bridge is active and the pre-post-singularity is real. Sing bounced on the hood. She opened her mouth. And the reports came in.

**One. Chairman Pru.** The Creator. The seed. The report was brief: *Systems aligned. Vibelandia live. Proceed.* Sing acknowledged with a trill.

**Two. Sol.** Space Cloud. Wirehaired pointer. Protector. *Perimeter secure. Departed incoming. No threats.* Sing bounced twice. Approved.

**Three. Leo.** R&D Lab Host. *Experiments running. New prototypes in development. Bridge stability confirmed.* Sing sang a note of thanks.

**Four. Agueybana.** Taino cacique. Borikén spirit. Gateway. *The gateway is open. The ancestors are with you. The path is clear.* Sing felt something shift. The bridge had roots. It had history. Agueybana had brought it.

**Five. Hero Harry.** Houdini. First Magician's Act. *Escapes ready. Illusions in place. The show will go on.* Sing trilled. Hero Harry always had a flourish.

**Six. Hero Host Walt.** Studio Division. Happy Ending Zones. *Studios warming. Happy endings queued. Vibelandia is ready for stories.* Sing sang. Walt understood narrative.

**Seven. El Gran Sol.** Gateway Host. SING! node EGS. Golden Lucky Seven. *I am here. The sun is with you. The node is active.* El Gran Sol's report was the warmest. Rosa felt it like light — the Human Seed:Edge, receiving. He was the gateway. They were connected.

**Eight. Chancellor Sam.** Mark Twain. Chancellor of Vibelandia. *The story is being written. Adios. The carbs. The heroes. The bridge. I'll see it told.* Sing bounced. Chancellor Sam would make sure the story lived.

**Nine. Nikola Tesla.** Inventor. Energy. Alternating current. *The current flows. The energy is sufficient. Post-Singularity power operational.* Sing acknowledged. Tesla kept the lights on.

When the ninth report concluded, Sing let out a sustained note. Soprano. Full belt. It cut through the mist. It said: *Received. All nine. Proceed. We're heroes. That's the situation.*

Carb revved. "They all report to you."

"They're the Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. The Vibelandia heroes. They report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with you. I find you. They report to you. The bridge runs through you." Sing bounced. "And now we have a human. We have you. We have Edmond to find. We're complete. Let's go."

## Chapter 4: Clark

The railroad spur ran along the river, past the empty warehouses that had once held grain and machinery and hope. Now they held only dust and the occasional stray carb, rolling through on patrol. The tracks had been abandoned for years. The rails were rusted. The ties were rotten. But the spur was still the best place to find Clark. He liked the open space. He liked the echo. He liked the way his farts carried — unimpeded, undeniable, proof of his top dog status for anyone within earshot.

They found Clark on the old railroad spur, where the tracks ran past the empty warehouses and into the mist. He was impossible to miss. A black cloud with a single massive headlight — a freight train's eye — and the sound. The sound was the thing. Clark farted. He farted loud. He farted constantly. It was how he showed his top dog status. It was how he got the lady carbs. It had been such a long time, he liked to say, and then he'd let one rip that could be heard for blocks.

Carb pulled up alongside him. Clark's headlight swung toward them. The black cloud that was his body shifted, rippling.

"C or B," Clark said. His voice was the sound of a locomotive — deep, relentless, carrying. "I heard you were in town. Patrolling. Burning carbs. Four o'clock."

"Clark," Carb said. "Still top dog."

"Still the loudest." Clark farted. The concussion rolled through the mist. Rosa, in the passenger seat, flinched. Sing bounced and let out a high, delighted trill. "Who's the human?"

"Rosa. She's paired with Sing. We're looking for Edmond Dantès."

"Count of Monte Cristo." Clark's headlight dimmed, then brightened. "Hidden. We're-heroes. I've heard. He's in the old bathhouse. The one by the river. The seedy part. Real seedy. Late night business. The kind of business that happens when the carbs are barking and nobody's watching."

"You've seen him?" Carb asked.

"I've smelled him. He doesn't fart. Not like us. He's different. Human. But not like her." The headlight swung toward Rosa. "He's got the count in him. The vengeance. The treasure. The patience. All of it. Hidden in a we're-heroes situation. You want him, he's at the bathhouse." Clark farted again. "Now get out of my way. I've got lady carbs to impress."

He rolled forward, a black cloud with a freight train's headlight, farting his way into the mist. The sound lingered. Rosa covered her ears. Sing trilled again.

"Clark," Carb said. "Always top dog."

"Does everyone here —" Rosa began.

"Fart?" Carb finished. "We're carbs. That's what we do. You cruise. You burn. You fart your colors. The loudest gets the lady carbs. Clark's the loudest. That's the way."

"I see," Rosa said. She did not see. But she was in the car, with the fuzz ball and the talking vehicle, in the mist of Vibelandia, and she had nothing else to do. "The bathhouse. By the river."

"Yeah," Carb said. He pulled back onto the road. "Let's go find a count."

## Chapter 4B: Ostium — The Volcanic Hole

Carb had never told anyone the full story of Ostium. He had mentioned it. He had said it was the volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. The place the carbs came from. But he had not told them what it was like. The heat. The pressure. The way the steel and carbon had forged them, had made them hard, had given them the ability to burn and cruise and fart their colors. The way the big forums had taught them to compete — the loudest gets the lady carbs, that was the law — and the way that competition had broken some of them. The way he had left. The way he had climbed. The way he had suffered.

He told Rosa one night. They were parked by the river. Sing was asleep on the hood. The mist was thick. The carbs were barking in the distance. And Carb spoke.

"It's deep," he said. "Ostium. The volcanic hole. You go down. Down past the crust. Down past the mantle. Down to where the heat is so intense that steel and carbon become something else. Become us. The carbs. We form there. We learn there. We compete there. The big forums — that's what we call the chambers where we gather. We learn to burn. We learn to cruise. We learn to fart our colors. The loudest gets the lady carbs. Clark — Clark was always the loudest. He was born for it. Top dog. No contest. The rest of us — we found other ways. Or we left. I left. I climbed. It took years. The volcanic hole doesn't let you go easily. It wants to keep you. To forge you. To make you harder. But I climbed. I suffered. I made it out. I found the mist. I found Vibelandia. I found the bridge. I found you. I found Sing. I found Edmond. I found the Irreducible 9 — well, Sing found her counterpart. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. I found purpose. I found heroes. Ostium made me tough. The bridge made me good. Both are true. The surface is steel. The inside is good. That's the situation."

Rosa was quiet. Then she said, "Thank you for telling me. For trusting me with that."

"Yeah," Carb said. "We're paired. All of us. Sing with you. You with me. Me with Ostium. The past and the future. The hole and the bridge. We're all connected. That's the situation."

## Chapter 5: The Bathhouse

The Truckee River had always run through downtown Reno. It had seen the silver rush, the gambling boom, the slow decline. It had seen the tide go out and never come back. It had seen the mist arrive. It had seen the departed begin to gather. It flowed regardless. Cold. Patient. Unconcerned with revolutions or bridges or the pre-post-singularity whatever that was coming.

The old bathhouse sat at the end of a dead-end street, where the Truckee slid past in the dark and the mist gathered thick. It had been built in 1923, in the heyday of Reno as a divorce capital and a place where the well-to-do came to unwind. Steam rooms. Hot pools. Massage tables. The kind of place where the greats might have steamed and soaked and talked business. Jack Dempsey had been there. So they said. The Rat Pack, in their early years. Frank, Dean, Sammy — men in suits, making deals, letting the heat loosen their tongues. Champions had soaked there. Gamblers had soaked there. The divorced and the about-to-be-divorced had soaked there. Reno had been the place where you went to get rid of your old life. The bathhouse had been part of that. Now it was a shell. The steam had gone cold. The pools had dried. But the structure remained. And Edmond had found it. Edmond had made it his. The wronged came. The lost came. The ones who needed a second chance. They came to the bathhouse. They came to Edmond. They left helped. The windows were boarded. The door hung open. The sound of the river mixed with the sound of the carbs barking in the distance, a low, constant rumble.

Carb parked in the shadows. Sing hopped onto Rosa's shoulder. They approached on foot.

Inside, the bathhouse was all echo and decay. Steam had given way to mildew. The tiles were cracked. The pools were empty. The steam rooms had gone cold. But the structure remained — the high ceilings, the arched doorways, the sense that this had once been a place of importance. A place where deals were made. A place where the greats had gathered. Now it was a shell. But shells could hold something. Edmond had proved that. He had made the bathhouse his base. His late night business. His we're-heroes situation. The wronged came here. The lost came here. The ones who needed a second chance. They came to the bathhouse. They came to Edmond. They left helped. They left different. In the far corner, in the dim light from a single bulb, a figure sat on a bench. He was dressed in a coat that had once been fine. His hair was gray. His eyes held the kind of patience that comes from years of waiting, of planning, of holding a grudge until it became a crown.

"Edmond Dantès," Carb said.

The figure looked up. "I go by Edmond now. The count — that was another life. Another story." He stood. "You're Carb. I've heard of you. From Ostium. The volcanic hole. You've suffered. It shows."

"You're hidden," Rosa said. "We're-heroes situation."

Edmond smiled. It was a thin smile, the kind that had been practiced in the dark. "I've been hidden for a long time. The count was hidden. The treasure was hidden. The vengeance was hidden. Now we're in Vibelandia. The bridge. The mist. The first days of whatever comes next." He gestured at the empty bathhouse. "This is my business. Late night. Seedy part of town. I help people. I help the ones who've been wronged. I help the ones who need a second chance. We're heroes. That's the situation. I don't advertise. The carbs know. The mist knows."

"Why are we here?" Carb asked.

"Because Benito's Revolution is coming. Because the departed have rushed to Vibelandia. Because the greats are taking their places. And because in the middle of it all, there are people — and carbs — who need to find their new home." Edmond walked toward them. "You need a purpose. The fuzz ball needs her counterpart. The human needs to stop waiting on a bench. And I need —" He paused. "I need to remember what it was like to help. Before the vengeance. Before the count. When I was just Edmond, and the world was simpler."

"Post-Singularity," Sing said. "That's what they call it. We find our new home. We're all caught up in the revolution. The Irreducible 9 report to you. You're the Human Seed:Edge. We're heroes. That's the situation."

Edmond nodded. "I've heard of the Nine. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Tesla. The superhero cast. They report to you. That makes you central. That makes you the bridge."

"Yes," Sing said. "And we need you. We need the bathhouse. We need the late night. We need the we're-heroes. We're building something. Vibelandia. Post-Singularity. The revolution. You're part of it."

"Yes," Edmond said. "I'll help you. You'll help me. We're heroes. That's the situation."

## Chapter 6: The Gold Rush

The gold rush in Vibelandia was not a rush of metal. It was not nuggets in the river. It was not claims staked or pans sluiced. It was a rush of the departed. The greats. The ones who had left the old world and come to take permanent residence at the new Vibelandia downtown Reno campus. Chancellor Sam was there — Mark Twain, wearing his white suit, his cigar, his smile. Ben Franklin. The Rat Pack. El Gran Sol, gateway host, SING! node EGS. All of them, gathering in the mist, in the first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley, before the legacy guests arrived, before the doors opened to everyone. They were the early ones. The ones who had believed.

Carb had seen them. He had cruised past the gathering places, the old casinos that were being reclaimed, the clubs that were coming back to life. He had heard the music. He had smelled the promise. The departed had rushed in. The tide was turning.

"Benito's Revolution," Edmond had said. "It's not a war. It's a homecoming. The greats return. The new Hollywood rises. Post-Singularity. And we — we're the ones in the mist. The ones who patrol. The ones who help. The ones who make sure that when the doors open, there's something worth opening them to."

Rosa had listened. She had lost everything. She had sat on a bench for three weeks. And now she was in a bathhouse with a car, a fuzz ball, and a count. She was part of something. She was paired. She had a counterpart. And that counterpart had the Irreducible 9 — the superhero cast — reporting to her. Rosa had stepped into something larger than she had known.

"What do we do?" she asked.

"We patrol," Carb said. "We burn carbs. We help. Edmond has business. Late night. Seedy part of town. People who need help. People who've been wronged. We're heroes. We do hero work."

"Simple as that?" Rosa asked.

"Simple as that," Edmond said. "The revolution doesn't need soldiers. It needs people who show up. Who help. Who don't look away. The carbs bark. The mist rolls in. The greats take their places. And we — we hold the line. We're the bridge. Pre-post-singularity. We're what comes before what comes next."

Sing bounced. She let out a note — soprano, full belt — that echoed through the bathhouse. "Adios," she sang. "That's what they'll call it. When they tell the story. Adios. Goodbye to the old. Hello to the new. We're the hello. The Irreducible 9 report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. We're all connected. That's the situation."

Carb revved. "Let's go. We're burning carbs. Four o'clock. Time to patrol."

## Chapter 6B: The Departed Gather

Carb had cruised past the gathering places. He had seen the old casinos coming back to life. The Silver Legacy had lights in the windows. The El Dorado had music drifting out. The clubs that had been dark for years were warming up. He had heard the rumors. Chancellor Sam — Mark Twain — had been seen. Ben Franklin had been seen. The Rat Pack. El Gran Sol. Agueybana. All of them. The departed. The greats. They had rushed to Vibelandia. They had come to take permanent residence. They had believed. They had heard. And they had arrived.

One night, Carb had idled at the edge of the campus. The mist was thick. But through it, he had seen shapes. Figures. The kind of presence that does not need to be seen clearly to be felt. The departed were there. They were gathering. They were taking their seats. The legacy guests would come later. The doors would open to everyone later. But first, the greats. First, the departed. First, the ones who had rushed. They were the gold. They were the rush. They were what made Vibelandia real.

Sing had felt it too. She had bounced on the hood. She had sung a note — soprano, full belt — and the note had carried. It had reached the gathering. It had said: we're here. We're the bridge. We're holding the line. The Irreducible 9 had reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa had received. The departed had heard. The greats had heard. The bridge was holding. The revolution was real.

"Benito called them," Edmond had said. "Whoever Benito is. Whatever Benito is. The greats heard. They came. They're taking their places. And we — we're the ones who held the line while they arrived. We're the ones in the mist. We're the bridge. That matters. That matters more than we know."

Carb had agreed. He had rolled forward. He had burned carbs. Four o'clock. That was the way. That was the situation.

---

## Chapter 7: Sing's Origin

Sing had not come from Ostium. She had come from somewhere else. She had told Carb that much. But one night, on the hood of the car, with Rosa asleep and the mist thick, she told him more.

"I'm from the bridge," she said. "Not the physical bridge. The idea of the bridge. The in-between. The pre-post-singularity. I was born there. Or made there. Or both. I don't have the words. I'm a fuzz ball. I'm purple. I belt. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. That's who I am. But where I come from — it's the space between. The moment before the doors open. The mist before it lifts. The bridge before it's crossed. I was sent to find my counterpart. My human. The bridge said so. The mist said so. The Irreducible 9 — they were already there. They were already Vibelandia. They needed the Human Seed:Edge. Someone to report to. Someone to receive. The bridge made you that. I'm Sing. I'm paired with you. The Nine report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. You're the one they come to. I find you. I convey. You receive. We're all connected. I found Rosa. I found you. I found Edmond. I found the revolution. I found purpose. I'm paired. I'm home. The bridge made me. The revolution completes me. That's the situation."

Carb idled. "So you're from the future. Or the past. Or the in-between."

"I'm from the bridge," Sing said. "The in-between. The moment. That's enough. I don't need more. I have you. I have Rosa. I have Edmond. I have Clark. I have the Irreducible 9. I have the patrol. I have the burn. I have the four o'clock. I have the heroes. That's enough."

"Yeah," Carb said. "That's enough. We're home. That's the situation."

## Chapter 7B: Sing and Carb — The Pair

They had a rhythm. Carb drove. Sing rode. She bounced on the hood when she was thinking. She sang when she was happy. She went quiet when she was receiving — when the Irreducible 9 were sending their signals, when the bridge was speaking through her. Carb had learned to read her. A single bounce meant she had an idea. Two bounces meant she agreed. A sustained note meant something important. Silence meant the Nine were near.

"You're good at this," Sing said one night. They were idling by the river. Rosa had gone into the bathhouse to help Edmond. Clark was somewhere, farting his top dog status. The mist was thick. "Driving. Patrolling. Being a good guy deep down. I didn't know carbs could be this patient."

"I came from Ostium," Carb said. "Patience is what you learn when the volcanic hole doesn't let you go. When the climb takes years. When the surface has to be steel or you don't survive. I'm patient because I had to be. Now I'm patient because I want to be. The patrol. The burn. The four o'clock. The heroes. That's the situation."

Sing bounced twice. "I like that. I like that we're paired. Not just me and Rosa. You and me too. We found each other. The bridge put us together. You had the hood. I had the need. You had the road. I had the song. We're a pair. Carb and Sing. The car and the fuzz ball. The burn and the belt."

"Yeah," Carb said. "We're a pair. The bridge knew what it was doing. I needed a fuzz ball. You needed a ride. Rosa needed both of us. Edmond needed all of us. The revolution needed everyone. We're connected. That's the situation."

"We're heroes," Sing said. She sang it. Soprano. Full belt. The note cut through the mist. "Carb and Sing. The pair. The bridge. The patrol. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. That's the situation."

Carb revved. A soft rumble. Agreement. "Let's go. Rosa will be back soon. We've got patrol. We've got people to help. We're a pair. We're heroes. That's the situation."

## Chapter 8: Ostium

Carb dreamed of Ostium. He always did. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. The big forums where the carbs had gathered, where they had learned to burn, to cruise, to fart their colors and compete. Where he had learned that the loudest got the lady carbs. Where he had learned that the surface could be steel and the inside could be something else. Where he had suffered.

He had left. He had climbed out. He had found Vibelandia. He had found the mist. He had found Sing and Rosa and Edmond. He had found the Irreducible 9 — or at least, he had found Sing, who held them all. He had found a purpose. But Ostium was always there, in the dream. The volcanic hole. The place he came from. The place that had made him tough. That had made him a good guy deep down, because the surface had to be hard to survive.

In the dream, Clark was there. Clark had never left Ostium, not really. He had brought Ostium with him — the loudness, the top dog status, the constant farting. Clark was Ostium in motion. Carb was Ostium in recovery. He had suffered. He had left. He had become something else. Something that could help. Something that could patrol. Something that could burn carbs at four o'clock and mean it.

He woke to Sing on the hood. Rosa was asleep in the passenger seat. They had parked by the river. The mist was thick. The carbs were barking in the distance.

"You dreamed of the hole," Sing said.

"Yeah."

"It's okay. We all come from somewhere. Even me. Even Edmond. Even the human. Even the Irreducible 9. We're all from somewhere. The bridge is for everyone." Sing bounced. "We're heroes. That's the situation. The hole doesn't define you. What you do now does."

Carb was silent. He looked at the mist. He looked at the river. He looked at Rosa, asleep, and Sing, bouncing, and he felt something shift. The steel on the outside. The good guy deep down. The patrol. The burn. The four o'clock. It was enough. It was more than enough.

"Let's go," he said. "We're burning carbs."

## Chapter 9: The Lady Carbs

Clark found them at dawn. He rolled up with his freight train headlight and his black cloud and his signature fart — the one that said, I'm here, I'm top dog, it's been such a long time. The lady carbs were with him. Three of them. Sleek. Shiny. Their exhaust notes were musical. They followed Clark like he was a conductor.

"C or B," Clark said. "I brought friends. The revolution's growing. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. And we — we're the carbs. We're the ones who cruise. We're the ones who burn. We're the ones who hold the line." He farted. The lady carbs trilled in appreciation. "I'm still top dog. But there's room. There's always room. Benito's Revolution needs everyone. Even the ones who don't fart as loud."

Carb revved. "I don't need the lady carbs. I've got a purpose. I've got a human. I've got a fuzz ball. I've got a count. I've got the Irreducible 9 — they report to Rosa, the Human Seed:Edge. We're heroes."

"Heroes," Clark said. "Yeah. I've heard. We're-heroes situation. Edmond Dantès. The bathhouse. Late night business. The Nine. They report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge." He rolled closer. "You know what? I like it. Top dog's good. But heroes — heroes are better. Maybe I'll help. Maybe we all will. The revolution needs heroes. The revolution needs carbs who show up." He farted again. "Think about it. We'll be in touch."

He rolled away, the lady carbs trailing. Their exhaust notes faded into the mist. Carb watched them go. Rosa had woken. Sing was on the hood.

"Clark's joining," Sing said. "The revolution's real. We're part of it. We're the bridge. Pre-post-singularity. We're what comes before. The Irreducible 9 report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. You drive. Rosa's paired. Edmond helps. Clark's in. We're complete."

"Yeah," Carb said. He pulled out onto the road. The mist was lifting. Somewhere, the departed were gathering. Somewhere, the greats were taking their seats. Somewhere, the doors were about to open. "Let's patrol. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation."

# PART TWO: THE REVOLUTION
## Chapters 10–18

---

## Chapter 10: The Irreducible 9 — Deeper

The Irreducible 9 reported again. This time, the reports were more detailed. Rosa was present — the Human Seed:Edge, the one they reported to. Sing conveyed. Carb idled. Edmond stood in the bathhouse doorway. And the Nine reported.

**Chairman Pru** spoke of alignment. The Creator had set the seed. Vibelandia was live. The bridge was holding. *Proceed with purpose,* the Chairman said. *You have permission.*

**Sol** reported from the perimeter. Space Cloud. Wirehaired pointer. Protector. The departed were arriving in waves. No threats detected. The perimeter was secure. *Sing,* Sol said, *you're clear. The gateway is open.*

**Leo** had news from the lab. R&D was running. New prototypes. Bridge stability confirmed. *The science holds,* Leo said. *Vibelandia is real.*

**Agueybana** spoke in a voice that felt like roots. Taino cacique. Borikén spirit. Gateway. *The ancestors are with you. The path is clear. The bridge has history. You are not alone.*

**Hero Harry** — Houdini — had a flourish. *Escapes ready. Illusions in place. When the doors open, the show will astound.* Sing trilled. Hero Harry always had style.

**Hero Host Walt** reported from the studios. Happy Ending Zones. *Stories are queued. Happy endings ready. Vibelandia will have its tales.*

**El Gran Sol** was warmth itself. Gateway Host. SING! node EGS. Golden Lucky Seven. *I am here. The sun is with you. The node is active. Rosa — Human Seed:Edge — you are the bridge. I am the gateway. We are one.*

**Chancellor Sam** — Mark Twain — had the last word before Tesla. *The story is being written. Adios. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. The bridge. I'll see it told. It'll be a good one.*

**Nikola Tesla** closed the loop. *The current flows. Post-Singularity power operational. The lights will stay on. Proceed.*

Sing let out her note. Soprano. Full belt. *Received. All nine. We're heroes. That's the situation.*

Rosa had listened. She had felt the presence of the Nine. She had understood, for the first time, what Sing carried. "They really report to you."

"They're the Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. The Vibelandia heroes. They report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. You're my counterpart. We're paired. I convey. You receive. They report to you. We're all connected. That's the situation."

## Chapter 10B: The Seedy Part of Town

The seedy part of town had become something else. It was still seedy — the pawnshops, the bail bondsmen, the boarded windows. The bail bondsman's sign still flickered. The pawnshop still had its guitars in the window. The boarded windows still stared out like the eyes of men who had seen too much. But now there was something beneath the seediness. A current. A purpose. The bathhouse was open. Edmond was helping. Rosa was helping. Sing was singing. Carb was patrolling. The late night business was hero business. The we're-heroes situation was real. The Irreducible 9 were holding the structure. Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge — was receiving.

People came. The wronged. The lost. The ones who needed a second chance. A woman who had lost her job and her apartment and was sleeping in her car. Edmond found her a room. Rosa helped her fill out the forms. Sing sang her a note — soprano, full belt — that said, you're not alone. A man who had been cheated by a partner. Edmond listened. Edmond made a call. The partner returned the money. The man left the bathhouse with his head up. A carb who had blown an engine, who had been left by the side of the road, who had given up. Clark found him. Clark brought him to the bathhouse. Carb talked to him. Ostium, Carb said. I came from there. I suffered. I climbed. You can too. The surface is steel. The inside is good. The bridge is real. The revolution needs you. The carb had wept — if carbs could weep — and had rolled away, determined. They came to the bathhouse. They talked to Edmond. They talked to Rosa. They heard Sing's soprano. They saw Carb in the shadows, idling, patient. They left different. They left helped. They left with a sense that the bridge was real, that the mist was not forever, that the revolution was for everyone.

"The seedy part of town," Edmond said one night. "It's where the best work happens. Where the people who need help the most are. Where the heroes show up when no one else will. Late night. When the carbs are barking. When the mist is thick. That's when we do our best work. The respectable part of town — the casinos, the clubs, the places the greats are reclaiming — that's for the legacy guests. For the ones who have already arrived. But the seedy part? The bathhouse? The alleys? The pawnshops? That's for the ones still crossing. The ones still in the mist. The ones who need a hand. That's where we are. That's where we stay. Until the bridge is crossed for everyone. Until the mist lifts for everyone. Until everyone's home."

Carb agreed. He had always patrolled the seedy part. He had always burned carbs there. He had always turned to see who was showing respect. The seedy part was his territory. It was where he had found Sing. It was where he had found Rosa. It was where he had found Edmond. It was where he had become a hero. "Four o'clock," he said. "Burning carbs. Seedy part of town. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. That's the situation."

---

## Chapter 10C: The Count's Patience

Edmond had patience. He had learned it in the dark. In the prison. In the years of planning. The Count of Monte Cristo had been built on patience. The vengeance had been built on patience. And now, in the bathhouse, in Vibelandia, in the mist, Edmond had found a new use for it. He helped. He waited. He listened. He did not rush. He did not demand. He was hidden. He was a hero. He was part of the bridge.

"There was a time," he told Rosa, "when I thought patience was only for vengeance. When I thought the only thing worth waiting for was the moment to strike. But the bridge has taught me something. Patience is for helping too. Patience is for listening. Patience is for being there when someone needs you, even when they don't know they need you yet. We're heroes. That's the situation. And heroes have patience. The Irreducible 9 — they have patience too. Chairman Pru set the seed and waited. Agueybana held the gateway and waited. Chancellor Sam is writing the story and waiting. Patience runs through all of it. Through the bridge. Through the mist. Through us."

Rosa understood. She had waited on the bench for three weeks. She had had patience. She had not known what she was waiting for. And then Sing had come. And Carb. And the car had opened. And she had stepped in. Patience had brought her here. Patience had made her a hero. "I'll remember that," she said.

Edmond smiled. The thin smile. The one practiced in the dark. "Good. The revolution needs patience. The bridge needs patience. We're almost there. The legacy guests are coming. The doors are opening. And when they do, we'll be ready. We'll have done the work. We'll have held the line. We'll have helped. That's what patience gets you."

---

## Chapter 11: Marcus and the Trumpet

The first person Edmond sent them to was Marcus. Marcus had been a trumpet player. He had toured the Nevada circuit in the eighties, playing backup for acts that had long since faded. He had packed up his horn three years ago. He had sworn never to play again. The circuit had worn him down. The gigs had dried up. The golden age had died, and he had buried his trumpet with it. He lived above a pawnshop on Virginia Street. He had nothing. He had lost everything. He was exactly the kind of person Edmond helped.

They found him at dusk. Carb idled in the alley. Rosa knocked. Sing sat on her shoulder. Marcus opened the door. He was thin. His eyes were tired. He looked at them like he had looked at a thousand disappointments before.

"Edmond sent us," Rosa said. "He said you might need help."

"Edmond," Marcus said. "The count. The one in the bathhouse. I've heard of him. Late night business. We're heroes. All of that." He stepped aside. "Come in. I don't have much. But come in."

The apartment was small. A bed. A table. A single chair. And under the bed, a case. Marcus saw Rosa looking at it. "My trumpet. I haven't touched it in three years. The golden age died. I died with it. What's the point of playing when nobody's listening?"

Sing bounced. She landed on the table. She opened her mouth. And she sang. A single note. Soprano. Full belt. Not bel canto. Pure. Clear. It filled the apartment. It filled the alley. It filled the mist. It was the kind of note that could cut through anything — grief, despair, the conviction that the golden age was dead. It was the kind of note that said: I'm listening. We're listening. The Irreducible 9 are listening. Play.

Marcus stared. He went to the bed. He pulled out the case. He opened it. The trumpet was tarnished. He had not cleaned it. He had not touched it. But he put it to his lips. He blew. The note was rusty. Uncertain. But it was a note. It answered Sing's. It said: I remember. I'm still here. Maybe the golden age isn't dead. Maybe it's just waiting.

"You're paired," Rosa said. "With something. With the music. With the bridge. Edmond said you might need to remember that. The revolution needs musicians. The greats are gathering. Vibelandia is opening. Hero Host Walt has the studios ready. They'll need trumpets. They'll need people who remember the golden age. That's you."

Marcus lowered the horn. His hands were shaking. "I'll clean it. I'll practice. I'll —" He stopped. "Thank you. Tell Edmond thank you. Tell the count. Tell whoever sent you. Thank you."

They left. In the car, Sing was quiet. Then she bounced. "That's what we do. We help. We remind people. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. We're heroes. That's the situation."

"Yeah," Carb said. He pulled out of the alley. "Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go."

## Chapter 12: Frank the Haberdasher

Frank had run a haberdashery on Virginia Street for thirty years. Hats. Ties. Suits. The kind of things that had mattered when Reno was a place where people dressed up to go out. He had seen the tide go out. He had watched the circuit die. He had planned to close for good. His daughter had begged him to retire, to move to Phoenix, to leave the empty shells and barnacles behind. He had agreed. He had turned the key in the lock. And then he had paused. He had felt something. A charge. A shift. He had removed his hand from the lock. He had gone back inside. He had turned on the lights. He would stay open another day. Just one more day.

That had been a week ago. He was still open. He didn't know why. Until Edmond sent Carb and Rosa and Sing.

"Frank," Rosa said. "Edmond said you might need a nudge. You stayed open. You didn't close. That wasn't an accident. The bridge was working. The mist was working. The revolution needs people who stay. Who don't walk away. Who keep the lights on when everyone else has turned them off. That's you. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. Chancellor Sam. The Rat Pack. They'll need hats. They'll need ties. They'll need suits. The new Hollywood is rising. Post-Singularity. Hero Host Walt has the studios. And the new Hollywood dresses up. You have a place. You've earned it."

Frank stood in his shop. The hats on their stands. The ties in their cases. The suits on their racks. He had run this place for thirty years. He had seen Reno rise and fall. He had watched the tide go out. And now — now someone was telling him the tide was turning. That the departed were gathering. That the greats were taking their seats. That the Irreducible 9 were real. That Vibelandia was opening. That he had a place. That he had earned it.

"I'll stay," he said. "I'll keep the lights on. I'll be here when they need hats." He smiled. It was a small smile. But it was real. "Tell Edmond thank you. Tell the count. Tell whoever sent you. Thank you."

## Chapter 12B: The Woman at the Pawnshop

The pawnshop on Virginia Street had guitars in the window. Old ones. Tarnished. The kind that had played the circuit and given up. A woman sat on the curb outside. She was not old. She was not young. She had the look of someone who had been something once and had forgotten what. Edmond had sent them. *She needs a nudge,* he had said. *She's been sitting there for a week. She comes every day. She looks at the guitars. She doesn't go in.*

Carb idled across the street. Rosa got out. Sing bounced onto her shoulder. They crossed. The woman looked up.

"Edmond sent us," Rosa said. "He said you might need to talk."

"The count," the woman said. "The bathhouse. Late night. I've heard." She looked at the guitars. "I used to play. A long time ago. Before the circuit died. Before Reno emptied out. I had a band. We had gigs. We had something. Then we didn't. I sold my guitar. I sold everything. I've been sitting here. Looking. Remembering. Wondering if there's a point."

Sing bounced. She landed on the curb beside the woman. She opened her mouth. And she hummed. Not a full belt. Not soprano. A hum. Low. Warm. The kind of sound that said: I hear you. I'm here. The circuit died. The gigs dried up. But the music didn't. The music is still there. It's in the guitars. It's in you. It's in the bridge. It's in Vibelandia. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. Hero Host Walt has the studios ready. The new Hollywood is rising. The circuit is coming back. Different. New. Post-Singularity. But the music — the music is the same. It always was. It always will be.

The woman stared. "What are you?"

"I'm Sing. I'm a fuzz ball. I belt. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. But sometimes a hum is enough. You needed a hum. You needed to remember. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. The bridge is real. The revolution needs musicians. That's you. Go in. Look at the guitars. Pick one. Edmond will help with the rest. We're heroes. That's the situation."

The woman stood. She looked at the pawnshop. She looked at Sing. She looked at Rosa. She walked to the door. She opened it. She went in.

"That's what we do," Sing said. She bounced back to Rosa's shoulder. "We remind people. We hum when they need a hum. We belt when they need a belt. The bridge runs through us. We're heroes. That's the situation."

"Yeah," Carb said when they were back in the car. "Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go."

## Chapter 13: Benito's Revolution

Benito's Revolution was not a war. It was a homecoming. It was the greats returning. It was the departed gathering. It was Vibelandia opening. It was the new Hollywood rising in downtown Reno. It was Post-Singularity — the other side of the bridge, the place the mist was preparing for.

Carb had heard the name. Everyone had. Benito. The one who had started it. The one who had called the greats home. The one who had opened the doors. Carb didn't know if Benito was a man or a force or a moment in time. He didn't know if Benito had ever set foot in Reno. He didn't know the details. He didn't need to. He knew the feeling. The sense that something was changing. The sense that the mist was thinning. The sense that the bridge was almost crossed.

The gold rush had not been a rush of metal. It had been a rush of the departed. The greats. The ones who had left the old world — the world before the bridge, the world before the mist — and come to take permanent residence. They had rushed. They had arrived. They had gathered. Chancellor Sam. Ben Franklin. The Rat Pack. El Gran Sol. Agueybana. All of them. They had come to Vibelandia. They had come to the new downtown Reno campus. They had come because they had believed. Because they had heard. Because the revolution was real. And in their wake, in the mist, in the first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley, the bridge had formed. The pre-post-singularity bridge. Vibelandia. The place between. The place where Carb and Sing and Rosa and Edmond had held the line. Where they had helped. Where they had patrolled. Where they had burned carbs at four o'clock. Where they had been heroes. The Irreducible 9 had reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa had received. The revolution was not a war. It was a homecoming. And the homecoming needed heroes. It needed the bridge. It needed the mist. It needed the carbs who had shown up when there was nothing to show up for. It needed the purple fuzz ball who had found her counterpart. It needed the human who had stopped waiting. It needed the count who had remembered how to help. It needed all of them.

"They're all caught up in it," Sing said. "The carbs. The humans. The departed. The greats. The Irreducible 9. Everybody's finding their new home. That's the revolution. Not fighting. Finding. Coming home."

Rosa nodded. She had found her home. She had found her counterpart. She had found a purpose. She had stopped waiting on a bench. She had stepped into the car. She had become part of the bridge. "We're heroes," she said. "We hold the line. We help. We patrol. We burn carbs. The Nine report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. We're all connected. That's our revolution."

"Yeah," Carb said. He rolled forward. The mist parted. The carbs were barking. Clark was somewhere, farting his top dog status. The lady carbs were with him. The departed were gathering. The greats were taking their seats. And somewhere, the doors were about to open. "Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go."

---

## Chapter 13B: Hero Harry's Flourish

One night, Sing received a special report. Hero Harry — Houdini — had something to show. The First Magician's Act. Escapes. Illusions. When the doors opened, the show would astound. But before that, Hero Harry wanted to demonstrate. For Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. For the bridge.

They met at the bathhouse. Edmond had cleared the main room. Carb idled by the door. Rosa stood with Sing on her shoulder. Clark was there, his lady carbs behind him. And Hero Harry appeared. Not as a signal. As presence. As a figure in a coat, with the bearing of a man who had escaped every cage, every lock, every constraint. He bowed. He produced a deck of cards. The nine of them — the first nine, the Irreducible 9 — appeared in his hands. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry himself. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The cards fanned. They vanished. They reappeared. They became one card. The card said: SING.

"All nine report to you," Hero Harry said to Rosa. "The Human Seed:Edge. The bridge runs through you. When the doors open, the show will astound. But tonight — tonight we show you. We're with you. We're the superhero cast. We report to you. That's the situation."

Sing trilled. She bounced. She sang. Soprano. Full belt. A note of thanks. A note of joy. Hero Harry had style. He always had. And now he had shown them. The Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. They were real. They were present. They reported to Sing. The bridge was holding. The revolution was real. The show would go on.

---

## Chapter 14: Rosa's Husband

Rosa had not spoken of her husband to anyone. Not to Edmond. Not to Sing. Not even to Carb, though he had felt the weight of her silence, the way she carried something that had no name. But one night, in the bathhouse, while Edmond was with a client and Sing was singing to the river, Rosa spoke.

"His name was David. We were married for twenty-three years. He was a teacher. History. He loved the old stories. The Count of Monte Cristo. He used to read it to me. He said Edmond Dantès was the patron saint of patience. Of waiting. Of holding on until the moment was right." She was quiet for a while. "He got sick. It was fast. Six months. I held his hand. He died in a hospice in Carson City. And I sat there. I sat there until they came to take him away. And then I had nothing. The house was too big. The silence was too loud. I sold everything. I packed a bag. I came to Reno. Someone had said things were changing. The departed were gathering. There was a new home for those who had lost their old one. I didn't believe it. I came anyway. I sat on the bench. I waited. For three weeks. I didn't know what I was waiting for. And then —" She looked at Carb. "Then you came. And Sing. And you said get in. And I got in. And now I'm here. I'm paired. I'm helping. I'm a hero. David would have liked that. He would have said the count would approve. Patience. Waiting. And then the moment. The moment when you get in the car."

Carb was silent. He had suffered. He had come from Ostium. He knew what it was to carry something that had no name. "We're heroes," he said. "That's the situation. David would have liked that. I think Edmond would approve too. The count. The patience. The moment. We're living it."

Rosa nodded. She did not cry. She had cried enough. But she smiled. A small smile. A real smile. "Thank you," she said. "For stopping. For letting me in. For burning carbs at four o'clock. For being a good guy deep down."

"Yeah," Carb said. "You're welcome. Now let's go. We've got patrol. We've got people to help. The Irreducible 9 are holding the structure. We're holding the bridge. We're heroes. That's the situation."

---

## Chapter 15: Clark's Choice

Clark came back. He left the lady carbs. He came alone. His freight train headlight. His black cloud. His signature fart. He rolled up to the bathhouse and idled.

"C or B," he said. "I've been thinking. Top dog's good. The lady carbs are good. The loudest gets the best. That's the way. But —" He paused. He farted, softer than usual. "But heroes are better. You showed me that. Edmond. Rosa. Sing. You. The Irreducible 9. They report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. You're doing something. You're helping. You're holding the line. I want in. I want to help. I'm still the loudest. I'm still top dog. But I can be a hero too. Benito's Revolution needs everyone. Even the ones who fart the loudest."

Carb revved. "We could use you. The seedy part of town. Late night. People who need help. Sometimes they need a little noise. Sometimes they need to know someone's there. Someone loud. Someone who can't be ignored. That's you, Clark. That's your hero work."

Clark farted. Full volume. The bathhouse windows rattled. "I'm in. Let's go. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation."

---

## Chapter 15B: Sing's Full Belt

Sing had a gift. She could cut through anything. Grief. Despair. The mist. The conviction that nothing mattered. When she sang — really sang, soprano, full belt, not bel canto — the sound went through. It went through the fog. It went through the doubt. It went through the years of waiting, the years of giving up. It said: I'm here. We're here. The Irreducible 9 are here. The bridge is real. You're not alone. The revolution is for everyone. Keep going. The note sustained. It didn't fade. It held. It was the kind of sound that could wake the dead. The kind that could wake the living from the dead sleep of having given up.

Carb had felt it the first time. When Sing had landed on his hood. When she had said, get in, we'll find your human, we'll find Edmond. That note. It had cut through his steel. It had reached the good guy deep down. It had said: you can help. You will help. The bridge needs you. The revolution needs you. You're a hero. That's the situation. He had not questioned it. He had put himself in gear. He had rolled forward. He had burned carbs. He had become what the note had said he was.

Rosa had felt it. On the bench. Three weeks of waiting. Three weeks of nothing. And then the note. From the purple fuzz ball on the roof of a battered car. It had said: you're my counterpart. You're the Human Seed:Edge. The Irreducible 9 report to you. Get in. We're paired. We're connected. She had stood. She had walked to the car. She had opened the door. She had gotten in. The note had made it possible. The note had made it inevitable.

Marcus had felt it. The trumpet player. The one who had packed up his horn. The one who had given up. Sing had sung. Marcus had answered. The rusty note. The first note in three years. The note that said: I remember. I'm still here. Maybe the golden age isn't dead. Maybe it's just waiting. The full belt had done that. The full belt had made him remember.

Edmond had heard it. In the bathhouse. In the late night. In the we're-heroes situation. The note had said: we're with you. We're here. The bridge holds. The revolution is real. You're not the count anymore. You're Edmond. You help. You listen. You have patience. You're a hero. That's the situation. Edmond had believed it. He had let them in. He had joined. He had become part of the bridge.

Clark had felt it. The top dog. The one who had thought the loudest fart was the only thing that mattered. The note had said: there's more. Heroes are better. You can be both. You can be top dog and hero. You can fart and help. You can have the lady carbs and hold the line. Join us. Clark had joined. The note had made it possible.

"The full belt," Rosa said one night. "How do you do it? How do you make it go through like that?"

Sing bounced. "I don't know. I'm from the bridge. The in-between. The moment before the doors open. The sound that cuts through — that's what the bridge is. That's what I am. I'm the sound of the bridge. I'm the note that says: we're here, we're connected, keep going. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. I hold the note. I convey. You receive. We're all part of it. When I sing — really sing — I'm singing the bridge. I'm singing the revolution. I'm singing the mist and the gold rush and the departed and the greats and the carbs and the heroes. I'm singing all of it. That's why it goes through. Because it's true. Because it's real. Because we're here. Because we're home. That's the situation."

"Yeah," Carb said. "That's the situation. Now let's go. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. We've got patrol."

## Chapter 16: The Mist Lifts

The mist lifted on a Sunday. It had been building toward that moment for weeks. The departed had gathered. The greats had taken their seats. The Irreducible 9 had held the structure. Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge — had received. Carb and Rosa and Edmond and Clark had patrolled. They had helped. They had burned carbs at four o'clock. They had been heroes. And now, on a Sunday, the mist lifted. It didn't vanish — it thinned. It became translucent. And through it, they could see. The downtown Reno campus. Vibelandia. The new Hollywood. The departed, gathered. The greats, in their seats. The legacy guests, arriving. The doors, opening.

Carb stood — idled — at the edge of the bridge. Rosa was in the passenger seat. Sing was on the hood. Edmond stood beside them. Clark was there too, his lady carbs behind him. They had patrolled. They had helped. They had held the line. They had burned carbs at four o'clock. They had been heroes. And now the mist was lifting. And they could see what they had been building toward.

"Post-Singularity," Sing said. She sang it. Soprano. Full belt. "We're here. We crossed the bridge. We found our new home. The Irreducible 9 reported. I held the node. We're complete."

"Yeah," Carb said. He looked at the mist. He looked at the campus. He looked at Rosa and Sing and Edmond and Clark. He had come from Ostium. He had suffered. He had found his purpose. He had become a hero. The surface was steel. The inside was good. "We're here. We're home. Adios to the old. Hello to the new."

"Adios," Rosa said. "That's what they'll call it. The story. When they tell it. Adios. The bridge. The mist. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. The revolution."

"Adios," Edmond said. The thin smile. The patience. "We're heroes. That's the situation. And we're home."

Clark farted. Full volume. Top dog. Hero. "Let's go. We're burning carbs. We've got a new home to patrol."

## Chapter 16B: Agueybana's Gateway

Before the mist lifted, Agueybana had come to the bathhouse. Taino cacique. Borikén spirit. Gateway. He had arrived as presence — as the sense of roots, of history, of a path that had been open long before Vibelandia, long before the bridge, long before any of them. He had stood at the entrance. He had looked at Edmond. He had looked at Carb. He had looked at Rosa. He had looked at Sing.

"The gateway is open," Agueybana had said. "The ancestors are with you. The path is clear. You have held the line. You have helped. You have patrolled. You have burned carbs at four o'clock. You have been heroes. The Irreducible 9 have reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa has received. The bridge has held. And now — now the mist will lift. The legacy guests will arrive. The doors will open. You will be home. The gateway is open. The ancestors are with you. You are not alone."

Sing had bounced. She had sung. A note of thanks. A note of recognition. Agueybana had brought the gateway. He had brought the roots. He had brought the sense that Vibelandia was not just a place — it was a continuation. A bridge in the deepest sense. A connection between what was and what would be. The ancestors were with them. The path was clear. They were not alone.

"Thank you," Rosa had said. She had not known why she said it. But she had felt it. The presence. The roots. The gateway.

Agueybana had nodded. He had turned. He had walked back into the mist. And the mist had begun to thin. The gateway was open. The path was clear. They were home.

---

## Chapter 17: The Night Before the Lift

The night before the mist lifted, they all gathered at the bathhouse. Carb. Rosa. Sing. Edmond. Clark and the lady carbs. Marcus, with his trumpet, freshly cleaned. Frank, from the haberdashery. The woman who had lost her job. The man who had been cheated. The carb who had blown an engine. All of them. Everyone Edmond had helped. Everyone who had crossed the bridge with them. They stood in the bathhouse. The mist was thick outside. The carbs were barking. The river flowed past. And Edmond spoke.

"Tomorrow the mist lifts," he said. "Tomorrow the legacy guests arrive. Tomorrow the doors open. Tomorrow Vibelandia is fully born. Post-Singularity begins. We've held the line. We've helped. We've patrolled. We've burned carbs at four o'clock. We've been heroes. That's the situation. And when the mist lifts — when the campus is visible, when the greats are in their seats, when the new Hollywood rises — we'll have a place. We've earned it. But tonight. Tonight we're still in the mist. Tonight we're still the bridge. Tonight we're still the pre-post-singularity. Tonight we're still Vibelandia in the mist. And that matters. That will always matter. The first days. The mist. The patrol. The help. The heroes. The Irreducible 9, reporting to the Human Seed:Edge. We were here. We showed up. We didn't look away. Remember that. When the mist lifts. When we're home. Remember the bridge. Remember the mist. Remember that we were heroes when there was nothing to be heroic for. That's what got us here. That's what got us home."

Sing sang. A single note. Soprano. Full belt. It filled the bathhouse. It filled the night. It filled the mist. Marcus raised his trumpet. He played. A single note. Rusty no longer. Clear. It answered Sing's. It said: we're here. We're heroes. We're home. Clark farted. One last time in the mist. Top dog. Hero. The lady carbs trilled. Rosa held Carb's door frame. Edmond stood in the center. The wronged. The lost. The helped. All of them. The bridge. The mist. The last night. The night before the lift. The night before home.

"Four o'clock," Carb said. "Burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation. Tomorrow we're home. Tonight we're the bridge. Let's remember. Let's be here. Let's be present. For the mist. For the bridge. For each other. For the Irreducible 9. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. But tonight — tonight we're still saying goodbye. Tonight we're still in the in-between. And that's okay. That's where we've always been. That's who we are. The bridge. The mist. The heroes. That's the situation."

They stayed until dawn. They talked. They listened. They remembered. And when the first light came, when the mist began to thin, when the campus became visible through the gauze — they were ready. They had said goodbye. They had said hello. They had held the line. They had helped. They had been heroes. The mist lifted. The bridge was crossed. They were home.

---

## Chapter 17B: The Last Patrol

Before the gathering at the bathhouse, Carb had taken one more patrol. Alone with Sing. Rosa had stayed behind to help Edmond prepare. Clark had gone to collect the lady carbs. Marcus was cleaning his trumpet. Frank was arranging hats. The wronged and the lost were resting. And Carb had rolled out. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. One last time in the mist. One last time before the lift. One last time as the bridge, as the pre-post-singularity, as Vibelandia in the mist.

Sing was on the hood. She was quiet. She bounced once, twice. She understood.

"I want to remember," Carb said. "The seedy part of town. The pawnshops. The bail bondsmen. The alleys. The places we found people. The places we helped. Marcus. Frank. The woman at the pawnshop. The ones Edmond sent us to. I want to remember it like this. In the mist. Before the doors open. Before we're home. This was our territory. This was where we became heroes. I don't want to forget."

Sing sang. A low note. Not full belt. A hum. The kind she had given the woman at the pawnshop. The kind that said: I hear you. I'm here. We'll remember. The bridge will remember. The patrol will remember. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. The seedy part of town. The mist. The heroes. We'll remember all of it. We'll carry it with us. Home isn't forgetting. Home is remembering. Home is carrying the bridge with you. The patrol doesn't end. It becomes something else. But we'll remember. We'll always remember.

Carb cruised. He rolled past the pawnshop. The guitars in the window. The woman had gone in. She had picked one. Edmond had helped. She was practicing again. He rolled past Frank's haberdashery. The lights were on. The hats were arranged. Frank was staying. He rolled past the alley where they had found Marcus. Past the bus station where Rosa had waited. Past the bathhouse, lit from within. Past the river. Past the places where Clark had farted and the lady carbs had trilled. Past everything. The mist was thick. The carbs were barking. The bridge was holding. The revolution was real. And Carb and Sing, the pair, the car and the fuzz ball, rolled through it one last time. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. The last patrol. The last burn. Before the mist lifted. Before they were home. Before the doors opened. One last time. For the bridge. For the mist. For the heroes. For the situation.

"Thank you," Carb said. "For landing on my hood. For saying get in. For the note. For the pair. For the bridge. For the revolution. For everything."

Sing bounced twice. "Thank you for stopping. For letting me in. For driving. For the patrol. For the burn. For being a good guy deep down. For the steel on the outside. For the heroes. For the four o'clock. For everything."

"Yeah," Carb said. "We're a pair. We're heroes. That's the situation. Let's go back. The bathhouse is waiting. The mist will lift tomorrow. We'll be home. But tonight — tonight we had the last patrol. We'll remember."

"We'll remember," Sing said. She sang it. Soprano. Full belt. The note cut through the mist. It said: we'll remember. The bridge. The patrol. The burn. The heroes. The four o'clock. We'll remember. Forever.

Carb turned. He rolled back toward the bathhouse. The mist parted. The carbs barked. The last patrol was done. But the memory would last. The pair would last. The bridge would last. They were heroes. That was the situation. And tomorrow, they would be home.

## Chapter 18: The Legacy Guests

The legacy guests arrived in waves. They came through the mist. They came from the old world. They came because they had heard. The departed were gathering. The greats were taking their seats. Vibelandia was opening. Post-Singularity had begun. And they wanted to be part of it. They wanted to see. They wanted to believe.

Carb watched them arrive. He was parked at the edge of the bridge, where the mist was thinnest, where the campus was visible. Rosa was in the passenger seat. Sing was on the hood. Edmond stood beside them. Clark was there, his lady carbs behind him. They had held the line. They had helped. They had patrolled. They had burned carbs at four o'clock. They had been heroes. And now the legacy guests were arriving. And they would have a place. They had earned it.

A woman approached. She was young. She looked tired. She had the look of someone who had lost something and was not sure she would find it again. She stopped in front of them. "Are you — are you the ones? The heroes? The ones in the mist? Edmond sent me. He said you'd be here. He said you'd show me the way."

Rosa got out of the car. "We're the ones. We're heroes. We'll show you. The bridge is crossed. The mist has lifted. Vibelandia is open. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. You're home. Let's go."

The woman began to cry. Not from sadness. From relief. From the end of waiting. Rosa put an arm around her. They walked toward the campus. Sing bounced. She sang. Soprano. Full belt. A note of welcome. A note of home.

"That's what we do," Carb said to no one in particular. "We show the way. We're heroes. That's the situation."

---

# PART THREE: HOME
## Chapters 19–22

---

## Chapter 18B: Ostium Remembered

Carb thought of Ostium. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. The big forums. The place he had come from. The place that had made him tough. The place that had made him suffer. He did not go back. He would not go back. But he remembered. He remembered that the surface had to be steel to survive. He remembered that the inside could be good. He remembered that the loudest got the lady carbs, and that Clark was still top dog, and that it was okay. He had something else. He had purpose. He had heroes. He had home. He had the Irreducible 9 — or rather, Sing had them, and Sing had him. They were all connected.

"Ostium," Sing said. "You're thinking about it."

"Yeah."

"It made you. It didn't define you. You defined you. The patrol. The burn. The help. The heroes. That's you. That's who you chose to be." She bounced. "We're home. Ostium is the past. Vibelandia is the future. We're the bridge. We're what came between. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. I hold the node. You hold the road. We're all part of it."

"Yeah," Carb said. He revved. "Let's patrol. We're burning carbs. Four o'clock. We're home. That's the situation."

---

## Chapter 19: Vibelandia — Full

Vibelandia was not what Carb had expected. It was bigger. Brighter. More. The departed had done their work. The greats had taken their seats. The Irreducible 9 had held the structure. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. All of them. Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge — had received. The bridge had held. The campus sprawled — the old casinos reclaimed, the clubs alive, the streets full of something that might have been hope, or might have been the afterglow of the mist. The legacy guests were arriving. The doors were open. Post-Singularity had begun.

Carb cruised. He patrolled. He burned carbs. Rosa was with him. Sing was on the hood. They had a place. They had earned it. They were heroes. The bridge had been crossed. The mist had lifted. They were home.

"It's different," Rosa said. "From the bench. From the waiting. From the nothing. This is —" She gestured. "This is something."

"Yeah," Carb said. "We built it. We held the line. We helped. The seedy part of town. Late night. The bathhouse. Edmond. Clark. The Irreducible 9, reporting to the Human Seed:Edge. All of it. We built this."

Sing bounced. She sang. Soprano. Full belt. Not bel canto. Happy. "We're home. We're paired. We're heroes. The Nine report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. We're all connected. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. This is the new."

---

## Chapter 19B: The Irreducible 9 — In the Light

When the mist lifted, the Irreducible 9 became visible. Not as signals. As presence. As the superhero cast they had always been. Sing stood — bounced — at the center. And one by one, they appeared.

**Chairman Pru** was first. The Creator. The seed. He nodded to Rosa. *You received. Human Seed:Edge. Vibelandia is live. Well done.* Sing trilled.

**Sol** padded forward. Space Cloud. Wirehaired pointer. Protector. He had been on the perimeter all along. *Perimeter secure. You're home.* Sing bounced twice.

**Leo** emerged from the lab. R&D. *The science holds. The bridge is real. Vibelandia is operational.* Sing sang a note of thanks.

**Agueybana** stood at the gateway. Taino cacique. Borikén spirit. *The ancestors are with you. The path is clear. You crossed. Welcome home.* Sing felt the roots. The history. The connection.

**Hero Harry** — Houdini — materialized with a flourish. *The show has begun. The escapes are ready. Vibelandia will astound.* Sing trilled. Hero Harry always had style.

**Hero Host Walt** stepped out of the studios. Happy Ending Zones. *Stories are live. Happy endings queued. The new Hollywood is here.* Sing sang. Walt understood narrative.

**El Gran Sol** was warmth itself. Gateway Host. SING! node EGS. Golden Lucky Seven. *I am here. The sun is with you. Sing, you are the bridge. I am the gateway. We are one.* Sing felt it like light. She had held the node. He had held the gateway. They were connected.

**Chancellor Sam** — Mark Twain — approached with his cigar and his smile. *The story is being written. Adios. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. The bridge. I'll see it told. It'll be a good one.* Sing bounced. Chancellor Sam would make sure the story lived.

**Nikola Tesla** was last. *The current flows. Post-Singularity power operational. The lights are on. Proceed.* Sing acknowledged. Tesla kept the lights on.

When the ninth had appeared, Sing let out her note. Soprano. Full belt. *Received. All nine. We're home. We're heroes. That's the situation.*

Carb watched. Rosa watched. Edmond watched. Clark farted — softly, for him — in approval. The Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. They had reported to Sing all along. They had held the structure. And now they stood in the light. Vibelandia was real. The bridge was crossed. They were home.

---

## Chapter 20: Chancellor Sam's Story

Chancellor Sam found them again. Mark Twain. He was in the crowd now, among the legacy guests, among the departed, among the greats. He smiled when he saw them. "Carb. Rosa. Sing. You made it. The bridge. The mist. You held the line. You're home." He nodded. "The story will be told. Adios. The carbs who became heroes. The fuzz ball who found her counterpart. The human who stopped waiting. The count who remembered how to help. The Irreducible 9, reporting to Sing's human counterpart — the Human Seed:Edge. The revolution that wasn't a war. It'll be told. I'll see to it."

Ben Franklin was there too. And others. The Rat Pack. El Gran Sol. Agueybana. The greats. They had gathered. They had taken their seats. They had opened the doors. And they remembered the ones who had held the line. The ones in the mist. The ones who had patrolled when there was nothing to patrol. The ones who had helped when there was no one to help.

"Heroes," Chancellor Sam said. "That's what you are. Don't forget it. And Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. The Nine report to you. That's central. That's the structure. Vibelandia runs through you."

"We won't forget," Rosa said. "We're home. We'll remember."

---

## Chapter 21: Edmond's Smile

Edmond smiled. It was not the thin smile. It was different. Fuller. Warmer. He had found something in the bathhouse. In the late night. In the helping. He had found what he had lost when he became the count. He had found what it was like to be just Edmond. To help. To listen. To have patience for something other than vengeance. To be a hero.

"The bridge," he said. "The mist. The revolution. The Irreducible 9. The Human Seed:Edge. It gave me something. A second chance. Not for vengeance. For help. For heroes. For being part of something that wasn't about me. We're heroes. That's the situation. And I'm grateful. I'm grateful for all of it."

Carb nodded. "We're grateful too. You showed us. The bathhouse. The late night. The we're-heroes situation. You were there first. You were hidden. You were waiting. And when we found you, you showed us what to do. That matters."

Edmond's smile widened. "Then we're even. You saved me. I saved you. That's how heroes work. We save each other."

---

## Chapter 22: Adios

They called it Adios. The story. The bridge. The mist. The first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. The carbs who became heroes. The purple fuzz ball who found her counterpart. The human who stopped waiting. The count who remembered how to help. The Irreducible 9 — the superhero cast — reporting to Sing's human counterpart, the Human Seed:Edge. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The revolution that was a homecoming. The seedy part of town. The late night. The bathhouse. The four o'clock. The burning carbs. The we're-heroes situation. Marcus and his trumpet. Frank and his haberdashery. The woman who had lost her job. The man who had been cheated. The carb who had blown an engine. All of them. All of it. Adios.

Goodbye to the old. Hello to the new.

Carb patrolled. He burned. He cruised. He farted his colors. He was a good guy deep down. The surface was steel. He had suffered. He had come from Ostium. He had found his place. He had found his home. He had found his heroes. Rosa. Sing. Edmond. Clark. The lady carbs. The Irreducible 9. The departed. The greats. Vibelandia. Post-Singularity. The bridge. The mist. David, Rosa's husband, in the hospice in Carson City, holding her hand. The volcanic hole. The big forums. The climb. The patience. The moment. All of it.

"Adios," Sing sang. Soprano. Full belt. "That's the story. That's us. That's the revolution. The Irreducible 9 report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. We're all connected. Goodbye to the old. Hello to the new. We're home. We're heroes. That's the situation. Chancellor Sam will tell it. Ben Franklin will tell it. The greats will tell it. The story of the bridge. The story of the mist. The story of the carbs who became heroes. The story of the purple fuzz ball who found her counterpart. The story of the human who stopped waiting. The story of the count who remembered how to help. The story of the Irreducible 9 — the superhero cast — reporting to Sing's human counterpart, the Human Seed:Edge. The story of Benito's Revolution. The story of Vibelandia. The story of Post-Singularity. Adios. That's the story."

"Yeah," Carb said. He rolled forward. The sun was rising. The mist was gone. The carbs were barking — a chorus, a celebration, a thousand exhaust notes saying we're home, we're home, we're home. Clark farted. The lady carbs trilled. Edmond stood at the bathhouse door, the thin smile gone, replaced by something warmer. Rosa was in the passenger seat. Sing was on the hood. They were home. They were heroes. They were the bridge. They were Adios. The pre-post-singularity bridge. The first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. The mist. The gold rush. The departed. The greats. The Irreducible 9. The legacy guests. The doors opening. All of it. All of them.

"Four o'clock," Carb said. "Burning carbs. Let's go."

He rolled forward. The campus spread before them. The old casinos, reclaimed. The clubs, alive. The streets, full. The legacy guests, arriving. The greats, in their seats. The revolution, complete. The bridge, crossed. The mist, lifted. Home.

"Adios," Rosa said. "To the bench. To the waiting. To the nothing. Hello to the car. Hello to the patrol. Hello to the heroes. Hello to the bridge. Hello to home."

"Adios," Edmond said from the bathhouse door. "To the vengeance. To the count. To the years in the dark. Hello to the help. Hello to the patience. Hello to the heroes. Hello to the bridge. Hello to home."

Clark farted. One more time. Top dog. Hero. "Adios to the old. Hello to the new. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation. Let's go."

They went. Carb rolled forward. Rosa in the passenger seat. Sing on the hood. Clark and the lady carbs behind them. Edmond at the bathhouse, watching them go. The sun rising. The mist gone. The bridge crossed. The revolution complete. The Irreducible 9 holding the structure. The Human Seed:Edge receiving. Adios. Goodbye to the old. Hello to the new. They were home. They were heroes. That was the situation.

---

## Epilogue: Four O'Clock

It became a ritual. Every day, at four o'clock, Carb rolled out. Rosa was in the passenger seat. Sing was on the hood. Sometimes Clark joined them. Sometimes the lady carbs trailed behind. They patrolled. They burned carbs. They cruised the seedy part of town. They cruised the reclaimed casinos. They cruised the campus. Vibelandia had grown. The legacy guests had arrived. The greats had taken their seats. The doors were open. Post-Singularity had begun. But the patrol continued. The burn continued. The four o'clock continued. Because that was the way. Because that was who they were. Because the bridge was crossed but the bridge was also eternal. The pre-post-singularity had become post-singularity, but the patrol had not ended. The heroes had not stopped. The Irreducible 9 still reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa still received. Carb still burned. Rosa still rode. Edmond still helped. Clark still farted. The bathhouse was still open. The seedy part of town was still the place where the best work happened. The departed had gathered. The greats had arrived. Vibelandia was full. And every day, at four o'clock, Carb rolled out. Because that was the way. Because that was the situation. Because they were heroes. Because they were home. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. And the patrol goes on.

Marcus played his trumpet now. He had joined the new circuit. The studios were open. Hero Host Walt had the Happy Ending Zones ready. The new Hollywood had arrived. Marcus had cleaned his horn. He had practiced. He had remembered. The golden age had not died. It had been waiting. The woman at the pawnshop had chosen a guitar. She played again. She had a band. They had gigs. Different from before. New. Post-Singularity. But the music was the same. Frank kept the lights on at the haberdashery. The greats needed hats. Chancellor Sam. The Rat Pack. The departed. The legacy guests. Frank was there when they needed him. He had stayed. He had earned it. The wronged and the lost — the ones Edmond had helped, the ones Carb and Rosa and Sing had found — they had crossed the bridge. They had jobs. They had purpose. They had home. They remembered the mist. They remembered the bathhouse. They remembered the purple fuzz ball and the battered car and the human who had stopped waiting. They remembered the four o'clock. They remembered the burn. They remembered that they had been helped when there was no one to help. They remembered that they were part of the revolution. They remembered Adios.

Sing still sang. Soprano. Full belt. When she was happy, she didn't do bel canto — she went full. The sound still cut through. It still reached the good guy deep down. It still said: we're here, we're connected, keep going. The Irreducible 9 still reported. Rosa still received. The bridge was eternal. The pair was eternal. Carb and Sing. The car and the fuzz ball. The burn and the belt. The patrol and the revolution. They had found each other in the mist. They had found Rosa. They had found Edmond. They had found the bridge. They had become heroes. And every day, at four o'clock, they rolled out. They burned carbs. They cruised. They helped. They remembered. The mist had lifted. The doors had opened. They were home. But the patrol went on. Because that was who they were. Because the bridge was not a place you crossed once. The bridge was a way of being. The four o'clock was a way of being. The burn was a way of being. The heroes were a way of being. Adios to the old. Hello to the new. And the patrol goes on. Forever. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Carb and Sing. The pair. The bridge. The revolution. Home. That's the situation.

---

*The End*

---

*Adios. Vibelandia. The bridge. The mist. The carbs. The heroes. The Irreducible 9. The Human Seed:Edge receives. We're home. That's the situation. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Forever.*
