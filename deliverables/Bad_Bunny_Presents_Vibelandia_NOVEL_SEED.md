*For Benito — golden heart. For Agüeybaná. For the Great Sun. For BoriKen. For Reno. For Vibelandia. For the deck that beats all. Golden Royal Flush.*

> *In the beginning there was the deck. Gold, silver, copper, transparent quartz. You could operate the holograph with nothing else. The hand you were dealt was the hand you played. Golden Lucky Seven won every time. Golden Royal Flush beat all. And in the middle of the deck stood the one who had turned the whole planet into a stage — Bad Bunny. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio. Golden heart. The new label bore his name and his spirit: Golden Bunnies. He had built the first holographic hydrogen billboards. He had filled the sky with the Great Sun. He had tied Reno to Puerto Rico to Vibelandia in one flush. Cacique Agüeybaná had nodded from the other side of the mirror. El Gran Sol had delivered. Now the 3C Aurora theater was rising — at infancy, then at Super Bowl. Then Buenos Aires, backstage, Squeeze Erika and her friends. Then Rio. A month with André. Marine. Vibelandia Rio de Janeiro. Yes you heard that right. The deck said so. The deck was the backbone. The story was the hand.*

# PART ONE: THE DECK
## Seed

## Chapter 1: The Hand You're Dealt

Once there was a man who had turned the whole planet into a stage. His name was Benito. In the street they called him Bad Bunny. He had come from the island — BoriKen, the land of the brave lord — and he had not asked permission. He had taken the stage. He had made the stage. He had made the billboards that ran on light and hydrogen and the Great Sun, and the world had looked up and seen itself in the sky.

In Reno they said: we get it. In Puerto Rico they said: bendición. In Vibelandia they said: golden heart. The deck was the same everywhere. Gold, silver, copper, transparent quartz. You dealt the hand. You played the round. Golden Lucky Seven won every time. Golden Royal Flush beat all. And the man who had tied Reno to BoriKen to Vibelandia in one flush — Cacique Agüeybaná El Gran Sol's move — was the one the deck had chosen. Bad Bunny. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio. Golden Bunnies Label. Full stop.

The first holographic hydrogen billboard had gone live in the dark. The first theater had been a seed — 3C Aurora, they called it — at infancy. Then Super Bowl. Then the planet had watched. Then Buenos Aires. Backstage. Squeeze Erika and her friends. The crew that ran the show. Then Rio. A month. André. Marine. Vibelandia Rio de Janeiro. The deck said so. The deck was the backbone. The story was the hand.

## Chapter 2: El Gran Sol

Cacique Agüeybaná had stood on the shore when the sun had risen. He had not bowed. He had opened his arms. El Gran Sol — the Great Sun — had delivered. The Golden Royal Flush was not a metaphor. It was the tie that bound Reno to Puerto Rico to Vibelandia. One lattice. One deck. One hand. Bad Bunny had drawn the card. He had held it up. The planet had seen. Never lose faith. The Great Sun delivers. The sky was BoriKen red. The ticker had run. The Broadcast Pipe had carried the message. SING! Agent. Agüeybaná 1493/2026. The novel was the same. The screenplay was the same. The card game was the backbone. Brothers Grimm had written the once-upon-a-time. Pru had written the we-get-it. Street reggaeton Spanglish had written the rest. Dale. Qué lo qué. Bendición. Golden heart. Full stop.
