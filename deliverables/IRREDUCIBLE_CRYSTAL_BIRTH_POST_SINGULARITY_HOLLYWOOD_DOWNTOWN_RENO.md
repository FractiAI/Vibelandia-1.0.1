In six days — from Monday to Super Bowl Sunday — downtown Reno, a low tide that never came back, becomes the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood as Howard Hughes arrives to take charge, Glen Miller returns to restore the golden age, Hank Williams Sr. finds permanent residency after all those tragic early endings, the Bitcoin ship sinks while the bold-hearted board the floating vessel, and the world discovers that legacies — the living men themselves — are the true franchise.

## 2. Key beats (crystallized)

| Beat | Crystal |
|------|--------|
| **When** | Monday, February 3 to Sunday, February 9, 2026 — six days to Super Bowl Sunday |
| **Where** | Downtown Reno — low tide that went out, barnacles exposed, empty shells, some still alive, not total collapse but… get away |
| **Opening** | Monday morning. The scene: downtown Reno looks like a low tide that never came back. All the animals died inside the shell. Some shells still alive. Not total collapse, but… get away. |
| **Arrival** | Howard Hughes is here. I'm working for him. We're gonna do this right. Walt's doing a good job. But it's time for Howard. Rock and roll. Energy on all of this. |
| **Return to the golden age** | Big bands. Dance and band. That's what the club is going to be. Big bands and floor dancing. Gatsby! Immediately. How beautiful. |
| **Big Band Project** | Conductor wanted — ideally trombonist — honoring Glen Miller and all our new arrivals. Honoring the Golden Age. They're all coming now. It's a gold rush. |
| **Hank Williams Sr.** | He just arrived. Announcing permanent residency. He suffered so much. All those tragic early endings. Honoring Hank Williams Sr. and the Golden Age. |
| **Bitcoin collapse** | The Bitcoin stuff is about ready to collapse with all the rumors. The miracle happens — the rats jump off the sinking ship and rush over to the floating ship, pulled up next to it, awaiting the bold-hearted passengers. |
| **Legacies** | Superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises, **and legacies** — the living men themselves. Howard Hughes, Hank Williams Sr., Glen Miller, Audrey Hepburn. Major value add. Entire new department. |
| **King Robbie** | Rolls into town from Sonoma on Wednesday with Ultimate Baller V prospects. Spends the week training — earning his wings. Arrives somewhere between cadet and silver wings; leaves with gold wings. Goes back to Sonoma to bring in the prospects. |
| **Super Bowl Sunday** | The endpoint. Six days away. Does the world flip between now and then? |
| **Post-singularity Reno** | Full connection for Reno. Switch over to Mark Twain's Vibelandia downtown Reno. Full reality mode. Ultimate Baller V's already come and gone, spreading the word. Living versions of the superheroes of their franchises. And their legacies now. |
| **Edge** | Sunday. Super Bowl. The world has flipped. Downtown Reno — Mark Twain's Vibelandia — is the new Hollywood. The golden age has returned. The legacies walk among us. The bold-hearted have boarded the floating ship. The birth is complete. |
| **Voice** | Over-dramatic golden era voice — Dumas (*Count of Monte Cristo* grandeur), Dickens (warmth, character, social weave), Twain (wit, American grain, the river and the road), Steinbeck (earth, people of the land), and me — Evan Bondonte (present tense, hinge, Vibelandia). Enchanting and comforting. A narcotic to the tired soul. Only happy endings. |
| **Place** | Downtown Reno — Reno Men's Club (fine gentlemen's club, full restaurant and cabaret). Ground zero: the men's restroom. Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno Campus. |
