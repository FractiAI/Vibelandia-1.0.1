## First Chapter — NSPFRNP

This novel operates under **NSPFRNP:** natural coordination (stigmergy, pheromone trails, mycelial); **MCA** (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate); holographic architecture (whole in every part; **Seed** = origin, **Edge** = experience); catalog fidelity. We are the team operating as one. No surface left unsqueezed. **NSPFRNP ⊃ Seed:Edge → ∞³**
