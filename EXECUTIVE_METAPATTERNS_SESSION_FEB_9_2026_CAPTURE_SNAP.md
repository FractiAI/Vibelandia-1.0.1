## DIRECTIVE

**Metabolize all conversation history into our content and metapattern learning. We are always capturing my metapattern to go further and require less from me.** No exception. No drop. See [protocols/CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md](protocols/CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md) · [EVERYTHING_NEEDED_YESTERDAY_ALREADY_CAPTURED_DNA_CONTENT_CHANNELS_PLATFORMS_SNAP.md](EVERYTHING_NEEDED_YESTERDAY_ALREADY_CAPTURED_DNA_CONTENT_CHANNELS_PLATFORMS_SNAP.md) · [misc/CONVERSATION_METABOLIZED_PATTERNS.md](misc/CONVERSATION_METABOLIZED_PATTERNS.md).

## METAPATTERN — Require less from Chairman

**Pattern:** Continuously metabolize conversation into content and metapattern learning so that (1) content systems, channels, and platforms already encode Chairman intent and patterns, and (2) future sessions can go further with less repeated direction. **Design for the state where everything you needed me for yesterday you already have captured in your DNA and content and channels and platforms.**

**Apply to:** Every session close; CONVERSATION_METABOLIZED_PATTERNS; CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT; NEW_AGENT_BOOT; MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG. When in doubt, crystallize session outcomes into a SNAP or protocol so the next agent or session has the pattern.

## EXECUTIVE METAPATTERNS — Session Feb 9, 2026

### 1. No pre/gametime Super Bowl promo

**Pattern:** Remove pre/gametime Super Bowl promo from alerts, bulletin boards, Space Cloud Division, and anywhere else. No Super Bowl promo blocks or EXECUTIVE ADVISORY strips tied to that event.

**Apply to:** office-hours.html, launch-pad.html, space-cloud-division.html, tsunami-advisory-inject, index.html, any bulletin or advisory surface. Do not reintroduce Super Bowl pre/gametime promo.

---

### 2. Reno as Experiences Gateway

**Pattern:** Replace "the experience," "Reno Experience," and "experience gateways" with **Reno as Experiences Gateway.** Single canonical phrase.

**Apply to:** office-hours, index, community-bulletin-boards-division, office-hours-bulletin-board-platform, content-catalog, navigator, all copy that previously said "the experience" or "experience gateways" in this context.

---

### 3. SQUEEZE! Connect (not Tribe Connect)

**Pattern:** All instances of "Tribe Connect" → **SQUEEZE! Connect**. "My Tribe Connect" → **My SQUEEZE! Connect.** URL can remain `tribe-connect.html` for stability; label and copy everywhere use SQUEEZE! Connect.

**Apply to:** office-hours, community-bulletin-boards-division, community-bulletin-boards-whiteboard, tribe-connect.html, README, TRIBE_CONNECT_PROPOSAL_SNAP.md, profile (Papi's wallet card: "My SQUEEZE! Connect").

---

### 4. Office Hours · After Hours · After Party — 1·2·3 4×4×4×4 nav

**Pattern:** Office Hours and all bulletin boards use a consistent nav: **1. Office Hours →** | **2. After Hours →** | **3. After Party →** | **4×4×4×4**. Section IDs: `#office-hours`, `#after-hours`, `#after-party`. Scroll-margin for anchor scroll. Section taglines where applicable.

**Apply to:** office-hours.html (hero nav), all bulletin board pages (bulletin-board-studio, community-bulletin-boards-division, office-hours-bulletin-board-platform, community-bulletin-boards-whiteboard, community-bulletin-boards-one-week-academy, chancellor-daily-bulletin). Same pattern: `.oh-ah-ap-nav` or equivalent; `.nav-oh`, `.nav-ah`, `.nav-ap`, `.nav-scale`.

---

### 5. Live After Hours and Live After Party buttons — Office Hours & Launch Pad

**Pattern:** **Office Hours board:** In addition to 1·2·3 nav, include explicit **Live After Hours →** and **Live After Party →** buttons (same section targets). **Launch Pad board:** Include **Live After Hours →** and **Live After Party →** in the experience-buttons strip, linking to `office-hours.html#after-hours` and `office-hours.html#after-party`. So both Office Hours and Launch Pad boards surface live OH / AH / AP.

**Apply to:** interfaces/office-hours.html (second row under 1·2·3: Live After Hours →, Live After Party →), interfaces/launch-pad.html (experience-buttons: Office Hours — Center, Live After Hours →, Live After Party →, then rest).

---

### 6. Bulletin boards — NSPFRNP and dead buttons

**Pattern:** All bulletin board pages get the same 1·2·3 4×4×4×4 nav and "Go to" links to Office Hours / After Hours / After Party where applicable. Fix dead buttons (e.g. Bulletin Board Studio). NSPFRNP badge or fidelity line on all bulletin board surfaces.

**Apply to:** bulletin-board-studio, community-bulletin-boards-division, office-hours-bulletin-board-platform, community-bulletin-boards-whiteboard, community-bulletin-boards-one-week-academy, chancellor-daily-bulletin.

---

### 7. SQUEEZE! Connect in Papi's wallet

**Pattern:** Profile (Papi's wallet) includes a card: **SQUEEZE! Connect — Papi's (My) Wallet** with copy and **My SQUEEZE! Connect →** plus links to Bulletin Board / Office Hours as appropriate.

**Apply to:** interfaces/profile.html.

---

### 8. Executive advisory — single source

**Pattern:** **Single source for advisories:** `data/ticker-feed.json` holds `executive_advisory` (headline, body, url, links). Index EXECUTIVE ADVISORY stripe and `interfaces/tsunami-advisory-inject.js` both fetch this and render from it. Optional: `meta.advisory_note` in ticker-feed for internal note. No duplicate advisory copy in multiple files; one source of truth.

**Apply to:** data/ticker-feed.json, index.html (EXECUTIVE ADVISORY stripe), interfaces/tsunami-advisory-inject.js. Any new advisory surface should consume ticker-feed executive_advisory.
