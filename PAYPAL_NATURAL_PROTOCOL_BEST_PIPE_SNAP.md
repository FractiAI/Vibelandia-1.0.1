## BRAND

**PayPal** = our **natural protocol** has identified it as the **best pipe** for payment. **Trust the protocol!**

- **Why only PayPal (for now):** Our natural protocol selected it as the best pipe. We don't add payment options by committee — we follow the protocol. One pipe, one flow, maximum clarity.
- **Usage:** Use this framing on checkout, Launch Pad, and any surface that explains payment. "Our natural protocol identified PayPal as the best pipe. Trust the protocol!"
- **T-shirt-grade:** *Trust the protocol!* is T-shirt slogan grade (see T-SHIRT SLOGAN content category).

## RULE

- **Payment pipe** = identified by **natural protocol** as **best pipe**. Only PayPal (for now) because the protocol says so.
- **Trust the protocol!** = closing phrase. Use on checkout and payment copy.
- **No apology** — we're not "only offering PayPal until we add more." We're offering the pipe the protocol chose. Trust the protocol!
