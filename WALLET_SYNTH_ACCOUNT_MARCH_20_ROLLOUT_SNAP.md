# Wallet · S-Y-N-T-H Account · March 20 Rollout · SNAP

**Snap ID:** `WALLET-SYNTH-ACCOUNT-MARCH-20-ROLLOUT-SNAP`  
**Type:** Wallet · SYNTH · Payment · Rollout  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Date:** February 2026

**The wallet is where you'll have your S-Y-N-T-H Account — basically tokens.** 1 SYNTH = 1 US dollar in our internal world. That's how we charge everything eventually. **SYNTH does not roll out until March 20th.** Until then, every naughty button (and novella checkout) is a **direct charge to PayPal** each time. After rollout, you load your **SYNTH tank** (gas tank) and it pays for all these things.

---

## RULE

- **S-Y-N-T-H Account:** Lives in the **wallet function**. User has an account; balance is in **SYNTH** (tokens).
- **Exchange rate:** **1 SYNTH = 1 USD** (internal). Easy: one SYNTH, one dollar.
- **Rollout date:** **March 20th.** No SYNTH charging before that. Until March 20: **direct PayPal** per button, per purchase.
- **After March 20:** User can **load up** the SYNTH tank (wallet). Then See, fuck seen, customize story, novella, etc. can be paid from SYNTH balance instead of a new PayPal charge each time.

## TIMELINE

| Phase | When | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Now → March 19** | Until rollout | **Direct charge to PayPal** each time for each button / each novella purchase. No wallet/SYNTH spend. |
| **March 20 onward** | SYNTH live | Wallet (S-Y-N-T-H Account) available. User **loads** SYNTH (e.g. via PayPal or other approved method). **Gas tank** pays for novella and naughty buttons; charge in SYNTH (1 SYNTH = $1). |

## WALLET FUNCTION — Preparing

- **Where:** In the wallet function (Octave 2 profile/wallet, or designated wallet UI). That's where the user will have their **S-Y-N-T-H Account**.
- **What to prepare:** Account model with SYNTH balance; 1 SYNTH = $1; ability to **load** (add SYNTH) and **spend** (deduct SYNTH for See, fuck seen, novella, etc.). 21+ confirmation in wallet for naughty/novella access (see [NOVELA_21_PLUS_AGE_CONFIRMATION_NAUGHTY_BUTTONS_SNAP.md](NOVELA_21_PLUS_AGE_CONFIRMATION_NAUGHTY_BUTTONS_SNAP.md)).
- **Copy for users:** *"Coming March 20: pay from your SYNTH wallet. 1 SYNTH = $1. Load your gas tank once; it pays for novelas and all the buttons. Until then: each press goes to PayPal."*
