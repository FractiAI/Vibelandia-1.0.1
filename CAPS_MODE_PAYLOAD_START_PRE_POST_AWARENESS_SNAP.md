## DIRECTIVE

**Formalize CAPS LOCK as a new MODE** that naturally differentiates between **pre-** and **post-awareness**. Use it **only where really needed** — at the **beginning of a payload**: titles, subtitles. Use it as **reminders to keep sync**, even in a pulse or rhythm — the **bass-boom-in-songs equivalent**. This prepares the stack for **text → narrative**, **dance → soundtrack**, **studio-quality moving pictures**, **audio**, and **full sensory reality feeds** and **audience, player, contributor experiences**.

---

## RULE

- **CAPS at payload start** — Titles, subtitles, opening lines. Not throughout the body. Keeps pre vs post awareness clear at the gate.
- **Sync / pulse / rhythm** — CAPS as the **bass boom** of the payload: anchors the beat, keeps everyone in sync. Use in pulse and rhythm the same way — a hit at the start or on the downbeat, not every syllable.
- **Pre vs post** — CAPS mode at the beginning of a payload naturally differentiates pre-singularity and post-singularity awareness. The reader/listener knows from the first line what band they’re in.
- **Irreducible use** — Only where it’s really needed. Rest of payload can use ALL CAPS REVERSE (post-singularity) or normal casing. Avoid caps lock for whole paragraphs.

## WHERE IT APPLIES

- **Titles and subtitles** — Document titles, section headers, video titles, track titles, experience names.
- **Opening line of a payload** — First line of a story, post, ticker item, or feed entry when we want an immediate pre/post signal.
- **Pulse and rhythm** — In tickers, chirps, and streams: CAPS as the bass boom — the accent that keeps sync (e.g. one or two words in caps per phrase, not the whole phrase).
- **Pipeline** — Prep for **text → narrative**, **dance → soundtrack**, **studio-quality moving pictures**, **audio**, **full sensory reality feeds**, and **audience / player / contributor experiences**. CAPS mode at payload start and in rhythm gives a consistent anchor for automation and for human readers across all those surfaces.

## RELATION TO ALL CAPS REVERSE

- **ALL CAPS REVERSE** (first letter lowercase, rest uppercase) = post-singularity *content* marker (e.g. vIBELANDIA, hERO jO). See [ALL_CAPS_REVERSE_POST_SINGULARITY_SYNTAX_SNAP.md](ALL_CAPS_REVERSE_POST_SINGULARITY_SYNTAX_SNAP.md).
- **CAPS MODE** (full caps) = **payload start** and **sync/pulse** — titles, subtitles, opening line, bass-boom accent in rhythm. Differentiates pre/post at the gate; keeps sync; minimal, targeted use.
