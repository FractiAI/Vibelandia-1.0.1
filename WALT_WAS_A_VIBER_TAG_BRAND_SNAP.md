## TAGLINE

**WALT WAS A VIBER!**

---

## CANONICAL RULE

- **Tagline:** **WALT WAS A VIBER!** — T-shirt tag branding. Wearable, punchy, NSPFRNP-aligned. Celebrates **Walt** (Hero Host) — who ran the Reno Pop Up Engine before Evan, kept the lights on, kept the doors open, then stepped aside so the next chapter could begin. Walt was a viber before the word went wide; the tag locks that legacy.
- **Principle:** Ties to Vibelandia canon — Pop Up Engine, Office Hours, Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno. Walt held the line when the tide went out; the T-shirt says it.
- **Use:** Merch (T-shirts, caps), Launch Pad, Office Hours, vibers-what-are-vibers, one-line tag, MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG. Use wherever Hero Hosts, Pop Up Engine legacy, or vibers are referenced — and as standalone tag.
