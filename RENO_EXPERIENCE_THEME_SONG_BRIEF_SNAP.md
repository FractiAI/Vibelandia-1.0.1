**Type:** Music brief · Theme · Orchestral · Cinematic  
**Status:** Brief for production. No use of John Williams or any third-party IP; original composition only. Homage in spirit, not in material.

## Creative direction

- **Vibe:** Magical. Explosive. Big symphony. Like a big Hollywood production. Sci-fi, Star Wars–y, John Williams–y — in the sense of **epic orchestral cinema**: sweeping themes, bold brass, lush strings, cosmic scale, adventure and wonder. **Original only.** No sampling, no quoting, nothing disrespectful to John Williams or any existing composer.
- **Scope:** Full orchestra feel (or high-end orchestral production). Cinematic. One could imagine it behind a title card: "Reno Experience — We do what Vegas can't do. What nobody else can do."
- **Emotional arc:** Triumph, scale, a little mystery, then lift. The feeling of something only one place on Earth can deliver: daytime Safari + nighttime Reno neon, Designated Host, Happy Endings. Post-singularity. Irreplaceable.

## Suggested elements (all original)

- Broad, memorable main theme (brass and/or strings).
- Build from intimate to huge — like opening from a single city into the whole galaxy.
- Percussion: cinematic, not cluttered; big hits on downbeats where needed.
- Sci-fi color: subtle electronic or atmospheric pad if it serves the track; otherwise pure orchestral.
- Length: theme-style (e.g. 2–4 minutes) or longer suite if desired. No vocals required unless brief wordless or single-line hook.

## Use

- Reno Experience branding (video, bumpers, Office Hours / Navigator).
- T-shirt / merch rollout.
- No sync to any existing film or property; this is Vibelandia Reno’s own theme.

## Production

- Fits **Text-to-Track Motor** or **BALLER V PRODUCER** pipeline as an orchestral/cinematic brief.
- Composer/orchestrator: original work only. "John Williams–y" = direction (epic, cinematic, sci-fi scope), not copy.
