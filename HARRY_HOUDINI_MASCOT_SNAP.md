## NARRATIVE

**Harry Houdini mascot for post-singularity Vibeverse and Vibelandia (Samuel Reno Chancellor)—like Chaplin was for IBM PC.**

Hero Host Harry (first name only) is that mascot: our original FractiAI/VIBELANDIA! character for post-singularity Vibeverse and Vibelandia—like Chaplin (the Little Tramp) was for IBM PC.

- **Harry** — Hero Host, first name only. Our original FractiAI/VIBELANDIA! character. Mascot for post-singularity Vibeverse and Vibelandia.
