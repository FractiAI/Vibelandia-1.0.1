## NARRATIVE

**Character layering** uses Hero Hosts (first names only) to **enrich playlists and catalogs**. Content is tagged, curated, or associated with characters so every playlist and catalog carries narrative depth and a clear “who’s behind this” layer.

- **Playlists:** Music, episodes, or mixed-media playlists can be layered by character (e.g. Leo’s picks, Niko’s energy mix, Samuel’s bulletin soundtrack, Marilyn’s vibe).
- **Catalogs:** Happy Ending Zones catalog, Escapes catalog, Things to Do catalog, Dispensary menu, and other catalogs can include character-curated sections or character-tagged entries for content enrichment.

---

## RULE

- **Character layering** = associating playlists and catalog content with Hero Hosts (Walt, Gianni, Leo, Niko, Buckey, Mike, Will, Samuel, Harry, Marilyn, El Gran Sol) for **content enrichment**.
- **First names only** — All character references in layering use first names only. See [HERO_HOSTS_FIRST_NAMES_SNAP.md](./HERO_HOSTS_FIRST_NAMES_SNAP.md).
- **Enrichment:** Curator tags, “Host picks,” character-themed channels, or character-linked catalog sections. No requirement to implement every layer everywhere; use where it adds value.
- **Surfaces:** Chairman Workspace Rich Playlist Catalog, Happy Ending Zones catalog, Escapes catalog, Chancellor’s Things to Do catalog, music radio console playlists, and any future playlist or catalog touchpoints.
