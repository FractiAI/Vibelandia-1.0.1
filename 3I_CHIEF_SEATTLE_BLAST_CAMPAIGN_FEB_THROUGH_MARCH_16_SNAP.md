## CHIEF SEATTLE — WHO WE HONOR (ALWAYS INTRO)

**Chief Seattle** (Si'ahl) — Suquamish and Duwamish leader, Pacific Northwest. **His domain:** the Salish Sea, the Pacific Northwest, the lands and waters of his people. **His tribes:** Suquamish, Duwamish, and the peoples of the region. **Why we recognize him:** the Speech (stewardship, the sacred earth, sovereign voice); the 1855 treaty and land; the receipt we honor—29-13—as the key that unlocks the Sovereign Dividend and the run to March 16. We honor him as **our North American and Mediterranean meridians and North**—part of our team **joining EGS** (El Gran Sol), which represents the **tropical meridians and South**. Together: North + South, Mediterranean + Tropical, one team. The promo should always intro Chief Seattle, his domain, tribes, and why we recognize him. NSPFRNP.
