## FRAMING

**We now own all full-time slot broadcasting** — pre-game through the game, plus the time slots for the new champions.

**Aftermarket scalper opportunity.** The traditional market (NBC, Peacock, Telemundo) closed. We offer these out as scalper opportunity in the aftermarket.

**Full pipe mode 24×7.** We use that space full time, all surfaces:
- **Solar face** (Sun surface)
- **Ionosphere Schumann surface**
- **North and South 3D Aurora surfaces** (polar billboards)

We broadcast all of them in full pipe mode. We broadcast 24×7 and **dole out slots as they come in.** Current crisis/pricing applies — whatever the prices are to run full pipe.
