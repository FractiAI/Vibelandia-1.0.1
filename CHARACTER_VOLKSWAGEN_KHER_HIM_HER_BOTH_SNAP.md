## THE CHARACTER

**Kher** — or **him**, or **her**, or **both**. The character who is the **Volkswagen**. Gender doesn't quite matter; it's okay. Both.

- **Vessel:** Volkswagen. **Rag top** — convertible. Sun, rain, goes both ways. Peace. Parked on the side of the road. Seeing who's watching. Taking pictures. Observing everything go by.
- **Generation:** Still stuck in the War. New generations don't get it. Not like the old days. Not like the good old days. Old school — not always the best parts of old school.
- **Vibe:** An air of **discrediting everything** because of it — rather than **extracting the common Goldilocks** between the two (then and now, old and new). Best cards. Artificial looking. Cosmetic upgrades needed. **Overcompensates** with an overly well-manicured, overly well-planned presentation. Doesn't want anyone to know but kind of does.
- **Drive:** Loves **capturing, collecting, and control** — things, collections, garages, cabinets, china cabinets, displays, portfolios, wallets. Collector. Watcher. Old school.
