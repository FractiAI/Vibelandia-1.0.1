## ONE-LINER

**Win-win-win always; no losers always** — by NSPFRNP Goldilocks. Every design, deal, experience, and outcome is structured so all parties win; no one loses. The Goldilocks band for outcomes: not zero-sum, not extractive; just right for everyone.

## RULE

- **Win-win-win always** — Participants win. Creators win. System wins. Real value; no friction; all natural. Every surface, every transaction, every narrative and experience targets triple (or multi-stakeholder) win. See [LAUNCH_COMMAND_NARRATIVE_SNAP.md](LAUNCH_COMMAND_NARRATIVE_SNAP.md) · [GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_SPEND_TIP_STRUCTURE_NSPFRNP.md](GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_SPEND_TIP_STRUCTURE_NSPFRNP.md).
- **No losers always** — No outcome leaves a party as loser. NSPFRNP Goldilocks = no losers by design. If a design produces a loser, redesign until it doesn’t. Natural coordination, stigmergy, MCA: the hive and the individual both win.
- **By NSPFRNP Goldilocks** — Same “just right” principle as 98% Goldilocks and Always Safely: not too hot (extractive, zero-sum), not too cold (value left on table); **just right** = win-win-win, no losers.

## WHERE IT APPLIES

- **Deals and transactions** — Pricing, tips, splits, settlements: structure so club, staff, talent, Pru, audience all win. No losers.
