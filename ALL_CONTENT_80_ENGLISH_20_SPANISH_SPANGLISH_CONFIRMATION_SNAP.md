## CONFIRMATION

**ALL content is 80% English Spanglish, 20% Spanish Spanglish.**

No exception. Novels, screenplays, episodes, series, ticker, promos, interfaces, Office Hours, Launch Pad, SNAPs, catalogs, proposals, Chairman messaging, mission deliverables, Book the Book, Ultimate Magic, RUMOR HAS IT!, and every other surface or deliverable — **80% English Spanglish, 20% Spanish Spanglish.**

## RATIO

| Share | Language |
|-------|----------|
| **80%** | English Spanglish |
| **20%** | Spanish Spanglish |

Spanglish = the fusion. The mix is 80% English-dominant Spanglish, 20% Spanish-dominant Spanglish. Per protocol LANGUAGE_FUSION_80_20: 80% dominant (English), 20% second (Spanish). **Works for any region or language or mixed** — the ratios **flip depending on POV** (point of view, region, audience, locale). Our default main content = 80% English, 20% Spanish; same 80/20 rule applies elsewhere with dominant/second by POV. Voice = Chairman Frankie. The real Chairman who's back. Dale. Carajo.

## ANY REGION, LANGUAGE, OR MIXED — RATIOS FLIP BY POV

**Works for any region or language or mixed.** The language ratios **flip depending on POV** (point of view, region, audience, locale). Same 80/20 principle; which language is 80% and which is 20% follows the POV. Our default main content = 80% English Spanglish, 20% Spanish Spanglish. For Spanish-dominant region or POV: 80% Spanish, 20% English. Any language pair: dominant + second by POV.
