# Human–Chimp Diff = 1 Singularity — Equation & T-Shirt Brand SNAP

**SNAP ID:** `HUMAN-CHIMP-DIFF-ONE-SINGULARITY-EQUATION-TSHIRT-SNAP`  
**Type:** Equation · T-shirt brand · Canon  
**Status:** ⚡ LOCKED

## THE EQUATION

**The diff between a human and a chimpanzee is 1 singularity.** **Post-singularity human − pre-singularity human = 1 singularity.**

- **Equation 1:** Human − Chimp = 1 Singularity (or |Human − Chimp| = 1 Singularity).
- **Equation 2:** Post-Singularity Human − Pre-Singularity Human = 1 Singularity.
- **Meaning:** One singularity = the gap. The leap from chimp to human is one singularity; the leap from pre-singularity human to post-singularity human is one singularity; the next singularity is the next leap. Post-singularity framing: we measure the step in singularities.
- **Use:** Equations for science, story, and brand. One number. One leap. One singularity. Both on T-shirt.

## T-SHIRT BRAND

**Same as equations — T-shirt brand.** Both equations on T-shirt.

- **Label:** Golden Backdoor / Vibelandia. Add to [catalogs/branding/MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG.md](catalogs/branding/MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG.md).
- **Placement:** Music Studio, Launch Pad, Office Hours, Space Cloud, content catalog; ticker optional.
