# Editorial — Redundancy, Tight, Minimal Viable Content · NSPFRNP SNAP

**SNAP ID:** `EDITORIAL-REDUNDANCY-TIGHT-MVC-NSPFRNP-SNAP`  
**Type:** Editorial directive · Always on  
**Status:** ⚡ LOCKED  
**Date:** February 2026

## IRREDUCIBLE MINIMUM CRYSTAL

**This Editor represents our current irreducible minimum crystal for all things** — including **content**, **surfaces**, and **experiences**. Nothing goes out without passing through it. Reduce to irreducible; mirror hardened; nested. One canonical source; elsewhere reference or link. MVC always. NSPFRNP.

---

## MISSION

An **editor** (human or agent) goes through **everything** and:

1. **Finds repeated redundancies** — Same phrase, block, or concept repeated across surfaces. Canonical source once; elsewhere reference or link.
2. **Preserves final tight** — One clear statement per concept. No filler. No duplicate paragraphs.
3. **Preserves minimal viable content (MVC)** — Enough for clarity and conversion; no excess. NSPFRNP: irreducible, mirror hardened, nested.
4. **Always NSPFRNP** — Natural coordination, MCA (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate), holographic (whole in every part), catalog fidelity. Editorial pass itself is crystallize + animate: reduce to irreducible, tighten nodes.

## RULES

- **Canonical source of truth** — Recurring copy (e.g. "We transform pre-singularity…", "layer and amplify", "Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers") lives in **one** SNAP or protocol. Other surfaces **reference** or **link**, or use a single short tagline.
- **One concept, one place** — If the same idea appears in README, prospectus, Office Hours, and three interfaces, keep the **full** version in one canonical doc; elsewhere: one line + link or inject from canonical.
- **Tight over long** — Prefer one sentence over three when meaning is preserved. Cut "that is to say", "in other words", repeated adjectives.
- **No loss of fidelity** — Tightening must not change NSPFRNP definitions, product names, pricing logic, or legal/legacy wording. When in doubt, preserve.
- **Editor protocol** — Use [protocols/EDITORIAL_REDUNDANCY_TIGHT_MVC_PROTOCOL_NSPFRNP.md](protocols/EDITORIAL_REDUNDANCY_TIGHT_MVC_PROTOCOL_NSPFRNP.md) for checklist and canonical phrase locations.

## SCOPE

- **Surfaces:** README, index, Office Hours, Launch Pad, prospectus, prospectus-update, one-pagers, interfaces (key landing and checkout pages).
- **Content:** SNAPs, protocols, episodes, ticker-feed, data copy. Prioritize user-facing copy first; then internal docs.
- **Ongoing:** Any new surface or SNAP should pass the editorial rule: no new redundancy; point to canonical.
