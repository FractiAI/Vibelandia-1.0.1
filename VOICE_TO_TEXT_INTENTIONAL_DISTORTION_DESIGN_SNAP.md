## Design decision

**Allow some typos and distortion from The Voice (voice-to-text) to stay in.**

- Source: **The Voice** — dictation / voice-to-text. Some output comes with typos, mishears, or slight verbal artifacts (e.g. "Established" → "Establishment" or similar; run-ons; breath-pause fragments).
- **Choice:** We allow a portion of that to **remain** in the final copy. We do **not** normalize every last word. A **slight amount of distortion** is kept — just for fun — without affecting the overall quality of output. In fact it **enhances** it slightly: it adds a little more **interest and attention** to the story they're telling and to the surfaces.

---

## Rationale

- **Quality:** Overall quality is not reduced; intent and clarity stay. We're not keeping noise that obscures meaning.
- **Enhancement:** The slight distortion adds texture, voice, and a human/imperfect layer. It draws attention; it makes the story and the surfaces feel lived and spoken.
- **Architectural layering:** This is a **design layer** — like a light grain or a soft edge. Surfaces and story can carry this layer intentionally rather than aiming for sterile, fully normalized text everywhere.

## Surprises and main branches

- **Fun, nice, interesting new surprises** have come from this. We really like them. Those are some of the things we're **minding** — paying attention to, valuing.
- **Some of the main branches come from such things.** Where it wasn't carved out or called out explicitly, it **came out through** one of these "misinterpretations" (quote-unquote). So the Voice-to-text channel isn't only texture — it's **generative**. New directions, storylines, and surfaces can emerge from the mishear or the typo; we treat those as valid branches when they land. Mind them; keep the channel open.

## Noise from the other side

- **Some typos may be coming from the other side.** Inserted through the already described protocols for using **noise as a way to communicate** — pre-to-post, biological to non-biological. So we don't assume every mishear is only artifact; we allow that a portion could be **signal** from the other side, carried through the same channel. Keep the channel open; mind the surprises; treat noise as potentially communicative within the protocols. Design note.

## Application

- **Story:** Narratives, episodes, SNAPs, and copy that originate from or reflect The Voice can retain selected typos/distortion when they add interest and don't break clarity.
- **Surfaces:** UI copy, labels, ticker lines, and surface text can use the same rule: a touch of Voice distortion where it fits the layer (e.g. contact bars, Good morning lines, section headers).
- **Design notes:** When documenting or handing off, cite this SNAP so the choice is explicit: intentional distortion from The Voice is allowed and encouraged within the bounds above. Architectural layering. Design notes.

## Boundary

- **Don't:** Let distortion obscure meaning, break links, or confuse critical instructions (e.g. protocol steps, safety, legal).
- **Do:** Keep a light, fun layer of Voice artifacts where it enhances the story and surfaces. Established from The Voice → we allow some of it to stay.
