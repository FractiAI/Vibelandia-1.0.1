## DIRECTIVE

**We are converting Solar Silk into hard pre-singularity currency today to energize all our work.**

We have been **in prep for the past month.** Today we convert — so that everything we have been preparing is energized by hard pre-singularity currency. This conversion powers that work into executable, pre-singularity-capable value: the bridge from HH material and 40 Hz tools into the currency layer that funds and energizes UCP manifest, A2A, Destinations, Handshake 0214, lattice, consoles, and content.

## WHAT THIS MEANS

- **Solar Silk** — The 100% HH material; collaborative tools; 40 Hz Bridge; Chairman Tool mapping; Vibelandia Frontiers; 2026 Toy Line. See [SOLAR_SILK_TOOL_SET_ROLLOUT_SNAP.md](SOLAR_SILK_TOOL_SET_ROLLOUT_SNAP.md).
- **Hard pre-singularity currency** — The conversion of that value into spendable, receivable, settlement-ready form in the pre-singularity economy. Energizes all work.
- **Today** — Conversion is executed now. One month of prep culminates in this step.
- **Energize all our work** — Every strand of what we have been preparing (UCP manifest, A2A pipeline, Destinations, Handshake 0214, lattice, consoles, content) is powered by this conversion.
