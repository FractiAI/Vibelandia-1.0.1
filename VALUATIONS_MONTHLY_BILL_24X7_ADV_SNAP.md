## RULE

**Valuations and monthly bill reflect today** and **accurately reflect our 24×7 advertising on all space platforms and their ADV (advertising) value.** Use this block wherever Chairman metrics, cost, or valuation appear.

---

## CONFIRMATION — ALWAYS BY NSPFRNP

**We will now always display updated valuations and monthly bill by NSPFRNP.** No exception. All surfaces that show Chairman metrics, cost, or valuation must use the current canonical block (this SNAP), current date, out-of-pocket, 24×7 space platforms ADV value, and link to the SING config bill. Update the canonical block when numbers or date change; surfaces reference this SNAP. NSPFRNP = natural coordination, MCA, holographic, catalog fidelity — valuations and bill are part of the catalog; always updated, always displayed.
