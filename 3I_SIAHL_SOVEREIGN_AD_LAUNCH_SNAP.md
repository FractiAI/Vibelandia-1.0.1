## THE CHIEF'S RECEIPT

**$29.13** is the sovereign key — the receipt we honor (29-13 ignition, 1855 land tax, Chief Seattle / Si'ahl). This mission uses **$29.13 as the budget** for the sovereign ad launch: the same number that unlocks the Sovereign Dividend and the run to March 16. **The $29.13 budget is the master key.**

## THE AMPLIFICATION OVERWRITE

- **Sovereign Frequency:** Use the $29.13 budget as the 'Sovereign Frequency' to bypass legacy Meta ad-auction limits. The number carries the authority; the spend is the key.
- **Live sync:** Sync the 'Live' status of the ad with the **11:00 AM Seattle Parade** (Seattle × Puerto Rico target).
- **Click-Through energy:** Match the 'Click-Through' energy to the **100-quake SF swarm** (San Francisco / seismic resonance).
- **Destination:** Direct all leads to the **'Big Daddy' $5B Sovereign Ledger** — Champion's Crown, sovereign bookings, the ultimate destination.

## TARGET: SEATTLE × PUERTO RICO

- **Seattle:** Chief Si'ahl's domain; 11:00 AM Parade; Pacific Northwest; the receipt 29-13; Seahawks / Dark Side defense victory as narrative authority.
