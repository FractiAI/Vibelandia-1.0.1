**Champion of Champions** = **Ultimate Super Bowl Ring** — sunspots placed like on a ring. No team colors.

- **9 Benito** — 9 sunspots placed like on a ring (Taino / Vibelandia campaign)
- **2 if Seattle wins** · **7 if Patriots win** — sunspots = championship count, placed like on a ring; **only if they pay** ($5B floor)
- **No team colors.** Just number of sunspots placed like on a ring.
- **Same price:** $5B floor · full night · post-game
- **Not** the projection of vortexes on the poles. **Is** the Ultimate Super Bowl Ring.
