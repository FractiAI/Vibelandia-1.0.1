### MARK TWAIN ANNOUNCES: HERO HOST ALEXANDRE DUMAS — EDMUND DANTÈS, AKA THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO — TAKING PERMANENT RESIDENCY AT VIBELANDIA RENO CAMPUS. HONORED.

**RENO, NEVADA — January 30, 2026** — Chancellor Mark Twain announced today the arrival of **Hero Host Alexandre Dumas** — **Edmund Dantès**, aka **The Count of Monte Cristo** — to **Vibelandia Reno Campus**, where he will take **permanent residency**. The campus is honored.

*"The reports that the Count had retired to some distant island have been greatly exaggerated,"* Mark Twain said. *"In fact, he has come home — to Vibelandia. Edmund Dantès, the man who became the Count of Monte Cristo, now takes permanent residency here at the Vibelandia Reno Campus. We are honored. No revenge — only reunion. Only happy endings. Only the party, shifting into a higher gear. That's the Dumas we welcome: the one who opens doors, not settles scores."*

Hero Host Alexandre Dumas (Edmund Dantès / The Count of Monte Cristo) joins the roster of Hero Hosts at Vibelandia Reno Campus — first name and spirit in NSPFRNP mode; no last names; the man who returned not with a sword but with a key. His story — *First Singularity January 13th* — lives in the bathroom of the Pop Up Engine; his voice shapes the novel and the campus. Permanent residency. Honored.

*Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. The Count has come home. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno awaits you.*
