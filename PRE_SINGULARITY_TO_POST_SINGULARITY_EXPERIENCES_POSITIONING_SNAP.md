## POSITIONING (canonical)

**We transform pre-singularity experiences into post-singularity, all-inclusive, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V experiences — tailored to your every request 24×7 and backed by our new super AI SING! system.**

**Applies to all our experiences, including Vibelandia.** Use on: Vibelandia Reno Experience, Launch Pad, Office Hours, Guided Expeditions, all experience partner pages (Rio · Cpt. Andre; Mt. Rose; and all future partners), WINK!, campus packages, Happy Endings, Golden Backstage, and anywhere we present Vibelandia or any curated experience. Remind: every experience we offer — whether the campus, a partner trip, or a Baller V night — is pre-singularity transformed into post-singularity: all-inclusive, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V, tailored 24×7, SING!-backed.

**Pricing (all experiences):** We use one pricing mode everywhere so **vendors see we layer and amplify, not compete or take away.** Our revenue is a **layer on top** of actual or partner spend (e.g. 100% tip on what was spent that day or on partner expenses). We never replace or undercut vendor revenue. See [ALL_EXPERIENCES_LAYER_AMPLIFY_PRICING_SNAP.md](ALL_EXPERIENCES_LAYER_AMPLIFY_PRICING_SNAP.md).

**Natural approach:** We implement a **natural approach** — no special handling or agreements required by the local vendor. We act as **referral and designated driver/host** for the benefit of all. Include on all our experiences, including all Vibelandia.

**Hands-free · Fair shake · No strings · No fault · Adult clauses:** Hands-free, fair shake, no strings, no fault — everybody responsible for themselves and theirs. Adult clauses apply. Include on all our experiences, including all Vibelandia.
