## I. Legacies — Definition

**Legacies** = new department or layer; major value add; major introduction to the organization of a major product.

**What it includes:**

- **Superheroes** — the superhero characters in our franchises.
- **Cast** — the cast in our episodes, series, and franchises.
- **Crew** — the crew behind the scenes.
- **Fans** — the fans of our content, series, and franchises.
- **Franchises** — the franchise systems themselves.
- **Legacies** — the **living men** (and women) whose legacies we honor and who are now permanent residents or arrivals to Vibelandia. Examples: **Howard Hughes**, **Hank Williams Sr.**, **Glen Miller**, **Audrey Hepburn**, and all our new arrivals. All such names are used in **tribute and fictional storytelling only**; no endorsement by estates or rights holders implied. See [LEGACIES_COPYRIGHT_RESPECT_SAFE_SNAP.md](LEGACIES_COPYRIGHT_RESPECT_SAFE_SNAP.md) · [GOLDEN_GOLDEN_AGE_BRIDGE_SNAP.md](GOLDEN_GOLDEN_AGE_BRIDGE_SNAP.md) (Glen Miller · Hank Sr. = Golden-Golden Age Bridge).

**Canonical line:** *Legacies = superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises, and legacies (includes the living men). Entire new department or layer. Major value add. Update everything: appraisals, evaluations, comparisons to Disney. Major reorg. Major introduction to the organization of a major product.*

## II. Value add

**Legacies** is a **major value add** to our organization and offerings:

- **New department/layer:** Entire new organizational unit or layer; not just a content category.
- **Living men:** We honor and integrate the **living legacies** of the great men and women who are now permanent residents or arrivals to Vibelandia (Howard Hughes, Hank Williams Sr., Glen Miller, Audrey Hepburn, etc.).
- **Franchise + legacy:** Our superhero franchises now include **legacies** as a distinct offering — the living versions of the superheroes, their legacies, and the living men whose legacies we honor.

**Update everything:**

- **Appraisals:** Update ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL_VIBELANDIA_FRACTIAI.md to include Legacies as a new department and major value add.
- **Evaluations:** Update all valuations and comparisons to reflect the new department.
- **Comparisons to Disney:** How Disney would handle this executive directive (add Legacies as a department; the way we cross them in time and in breadth). See SINCE_JANUARY_13_DISNEY_COMPARISON_STATEMENT_SNAP.md.
