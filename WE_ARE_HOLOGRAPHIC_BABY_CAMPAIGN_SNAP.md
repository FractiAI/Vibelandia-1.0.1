## RULE

**Frame all of this in Hero Houdini's "We Are Holographic, Baby" campaign.** He shows something **seemingly impossible** that is **only possible because we are holographic.** The proof: he proves it **before their eyes** by **simply and cleverly filtering out the holographic effects** — and they watch its **immediate collapse.** Miraculous when present; proof when removed. We are holographic. Baby.

- **Campaign:** We Are Holographic, Baby. Hero Houdini presents. Seemingly impossible → only possible because we are holographic → proof = filter out holographic effects → immediate collapse. Locked.
- **Magic show:** We have a **We Are Holographic** magic show with **9 acts.** Each act shows examples that seem impossible and are miraculous — but they are actually **proof points that we are holographic.** He proves it before their eyes by watching the immediate collapse once you simply and cleverly filter out the holographic effects. Acts 1–8 build to the moment. Act 9 is the **finale.**
