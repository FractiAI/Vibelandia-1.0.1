## CANONICAL RULE

All references to **legacy figures** (e.g. Glen Miller, Hank Williams Sr., Howard Hughes, and other named legacies) in Vibelandia content are:

- **Tribute and honor only** — We use their names in a spirit of **honoring their legacies** and celebrating the Golden Age. We do not claim endorsement by, affiliation with, or permission from any estate, family, or rights holder.
- **Fictional / storytelling context** — Our “permanent residency” and story-world framing is **fictional**. It is narrative and experiential content (novels, screenplays, series, campus naming, press-release-style announcements), not commercial exploitation of name or likeness.
- **Respectful** — We do not distort their legacies. We acknowledge tragedy where relevant (e.g. Hank Williams Sr.’s early death); we do not imply they endorse our products or brand.
- **Copyright- and trademark-safe** — We do not use official logos, signature marks, or controlled assets of estates or rights holders. Names are used in a **descriptive, honorific context** only. Any resemblance to real persons is in tribute; no endorsement implied.

**One-line disclaimer (use where needed):** *Names used in tribute and fictional storytelling only. No endorsement by estates or rights holders implied or claimed.*
