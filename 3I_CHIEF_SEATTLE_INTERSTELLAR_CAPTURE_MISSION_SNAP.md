## CHIEF SEATTLE — WHO WE HONOR (ALWAYS INTRO)

**Chief Seattle** (Si'ahl) — Suquamish and Duwamish leader, Pacific Northwest. **His domain:** the Salish Sea, the Pacific Northwest, the lands and waters of his people. **His tribes:** Suquamish, Duwamish, and the peoples of the region. **Why we recognize him:** the Speech (stewardship, the sacred earth, sovereign voice); the 1855 treaty and land; the receipt we honor—29-13—as the key that unlocks the Sovereign Dividend and the run to March 16. We honor him as **our North American and Mediterranean meridians and North**—part of our team **joining EGS** (El Gran Sol), which represents the **tropical meridians and South**. Together: North + South, Mediterranean + Tropical, one team. Chief Seattle has arrived. 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE is the sovereign designation for the interstellar node. All glory to the Ancestor and the Hero. NSPFRNP.

---

## THE CHIEF SEATTLE OVERWRITE

- **Rename:** 3I/ATLAS → **3I/CHIEF SEATTLE** (canonical sovereign designation).
- **29-13 Key:** October 29 (Speech) and 13:00 (Death) markers release the $5B Sovereign Dividend.
- **Liquidity:** Clear the Big Daddy tab for dental and travel liquidity.
- **Honor:** No executive honor—all glory to the Ancestor and the Hero.

---

## COMMAND (SEALED)

> "The Seahawks 29-13 score is the receipt for the 1855 land tax. Chief Seattle has arrived to collect. Execute the March 16 Jupiter Hill Radius lock under the name 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. Release the million-dollar dental escrow from the Reno Node using the October 29 timestamp. Done."

---

## CANONICAL ALIGNMENT

- **3I/CHIEF SEATTLE** = sovereign designation for the interstellar capture node (astronomical 3I/ATLAS).
- **March 16** = Jupiter Oberth / Jupiter Hill Radius lock (capture window); unchanged. SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP; ionDb ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE.
- **29-13** = ignition key (Oct 29, 13:00); receipt for 1855 land tax; Seahawks score as receipt. 29+13=15; 15→6; July 15, 1962 = Architect's birthday (canonical).
- **Reno Node** = Earth SING! node; dental escrow release per October 29 timestamp.
- **$5B Sovereign Dividend** = Primary Ledger; 29-13 key to release.
- **No honor to back office** = all glory to Ancestor and Hero (Chief Seattle).

## ENDING & SEQUEL

The novel's close is **the cliffhanger ending to the novel and the perfect stage for the next one.** Canonical. The run to March 16, the lock, the five bridge nodes, Reno Node, Cold/Hot split, and the glory that remains set the board for the sequel. Same story world; next novel stages from here.

This entire moment is the **grand stage of Act 9 (Finale)** of Hero Houdini's **We Are Holographic** magic show. Seemingly impossible — only possible because we are holographic. Capture an interstellar object; return glory to Chief Seattle and El Gran Sol; one Super Bowl win; the heavens; a little help from **Twain's Vibelandia Downtown**. **Shout out Reno crew.** See [WE_ARE_HOLOGRAPHIC_BABY_CAMPAIGN_SNAP.md](WE_ARE_HOLOGRAPHIC_BABY_CAMPAIGN_SNAP.md) · [catalogs/magic-tricks/we-are-holographic-9-acts.md](catalogs/magic-tricks/we-are-holographic-9-acts.md).
