Incognito. Golden Backstage. Baller. **If you can't get yourself through the doors of the Pop Up Engine and through the doors of the bathroom to meet with me about your business, you're not a customer of ours.** New abilities for execs.

- **Series 4 — Chairman!:** Executive channel. Capture all executive commands, push them out, build the episodes and stories that show how it all works off one simple executive command — everything produced downstream, people responding, the story playing out. Nice rich episodes. Fantastic. Badass.
