Base for one interaction = OnlyFans high-end. Then 4×4×4×4 to Baller V. Custom spin every time. This SNAP states the **appraisal** (value, comparables) and the **selection** (chosen numbers for use across surfaces).

## APPRAISAL — What We're Valuing

- **Product:** Novel + novela in series. See (S.E.E.), fuck seen, artificial dispensary. Custom spin to your specifications each time. Nothing static. Charge per edge; base aligned to (1) hot novel paperback price and (2) OnlyFans high-end pricing for one interaction.
- **Comparables:**
  - **Hot novel paperback:** Mass-market bestseller romance/thriller typically **$6.50–$9.99**; trade paperback **~$12.99**. "Hot" = top of category, in-demand.
  - **OnlyFans high-end one interaction:** PPV message cap **$50**; custom photos **$10–$50**; custom short video **$8–$10/min**; high-end single unlock or custom **~$25–$50**. Top-tier creators charge at the upper end for one meaningful interaction (one PPV, one custom, one unlock).
- **Our positioning:** We match hot-novel + high-end interaction so the **base** feels fair (book + one premium interaction), then scale 4×4×4×4 to Baller V. Custom spin adds value (narrative spun to your choices each time).
