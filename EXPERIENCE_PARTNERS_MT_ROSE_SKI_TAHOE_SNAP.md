## OUR LAYER (pricing)

We price ourselves as a **separate layer**: **100% tip on what was actually spent that day.** Guest pays the mountain (lifts, rentals, food, etc.) directly or as they go. At day’s end, our layer = 100% of actual spend that day. All-inclusive, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V, 24×7, SING!-backed.

## POSITIONING (canonical)

We transform pre-singularity experiences into post-singularity, all-inclusive, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V experiences — tailored to your every request 24×7 and backed by our new super AI SING! system.
