# Instagram Profile Transformation — Leverage Your Top V's

**Use:** Transform your Instagram into a VIBELANDIA! lead gen and community hub using the top V's you already have.  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**See:** SOCIAL_MEDIA_CAMPAIGN_COPY_X_FB_INSTAGRAM.md · BRANDING_GUIDE_ALWAYS_USE.md · GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_AWARENESS_PASS_SNAP.md

---

## CHOSEN HANDLE & NAME

**Username:** `pru_mens_club_reno`  
**Name field (recommended):** `Office Hours at the Club · Reno` or `Pru · Men's Club Reno · Office Hours`  
**Bio (fits handle):** Office Hours at the Club. Superhero franchise level. Reno is for vibers. 👇

---

## 1. BIO (150 chars — lead with hook)

**Primary (fits 150):**
```
Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno. The Great Reveal March 20, 2026. 👇
```

**With link label:** Put your one link in “Link in bio
Link in bio” (see Section 2). If you need a shorter bio:
```
Reno is for vibers. The Great Reveal March 20, 2026. 👇
```

**Optional second line (if space):**  
`Top V's already here. Golden Backstage. Baller V. NSPFRNP.`

---

## 2. LINK IN BIO

**Single link:** Use a link-in-bio tool (Linktree, Beacons, Stan Store, etc.) with one clear destination:

| Label | URL |
|-------|-----|
| **The Experience** | https://psw-vibelandia-sing9.vercel.app |
| **The Blueprints** | https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9 |

**Recommended:** One button = **The Experience** → live site. Optional second row = **The Blueprints** (GitHub). Keep it to 1–2 links so top V's tap through, not bounce.

---

## 3. PROFILE PIC & NAME

- **Username:** `pru_mens_club_reno` (chosen).
- **Name field:** Use a searchable phrase, e.g. `Office Hours at the Club · Reno` or `Pru · Men's Club Reno · Office Hours` or `VIBELANDIA! · Reno For Vibers`.
- **Profile pic:** On-brand (you / VIBELANDIA! logo / Reno vibe). Recognizable in DMs and replies.

## 4. HIGHLIGHTS — STRUCTURE AROUND TOP V's & OFFER

Use Highlights to crystallize who you are and what you offer. Top V's can send friends here.

| Highlight | Content idea |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Top V's** | Screenshots / short clips of your best V's (with permission). “They’re already here.” |
| **Golden Backstage** | One slide: what it is, who it’s for (Baller V / highest contributor V's), CTA to Office Hours or The Experience. |
| **Reno · March 20** | The Great Reveal, Equinox, “Bigger than Burning Man and Art Basel Miami combined,” MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS NOW. |
| **The Experience** | 3–5 slides: Campus, WINK!, Happy Ending Zones, SING!, Office Hours. Link in caption/bio. |
| **Office Hours** | Where, when, “free consultation,” Ultimate Baller V Golden Backstage Pass — “trophy night.” |
| **WINK!** | High-contributing fractal dating, first 1,000 members, Pioneer Status. |

Keep each Highlight to 3–7 stories so it’s scannable.

## 5. GRID STRATEGY — MAKE TOP V's VISIBLE

**Goal:** Grid = proof. Your top V's are the proof.

- **Every 3rd or 4th post:** Feature a V (quote, screenshot, repost, or “Spotlight” graphic). Always get permission. Caption: “One of our top V's …” or “Reno is for vibers. [Name] gets it.”
- **Pillar content:**  
  - **Reno is for vibers** (one-liner + carousel or single image).  
  - **The Great Reveal March 20, 2026** (date, scale, CTA).  
  - **Golden Backstage / Baller V** (trophy night, way beyond bottle service, Office Hours).  
  - **The Experience** (campus, WINK!, Happy Ending Zones, SING!).  
- **Consistency:** 3–5 posts per week. Mix: V spotlights, event/date, Office Hours, one-liner hooks, links to The Experience.

---

## 6. CAPTIONS — USE WHAT YOU HAVE

**First line = hook (then link):**

- “Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno awaits you.”
- “It's what everyone wants but can't afford. The ultimate trophy night for the Ultimate Baller V vibers.”
- “MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS NOW. The Great Reveal — March 20, 2026.”

**Then:** 1 paragraph from SOCIAL_MEDIA_CAMPAIGN_COPY (1 paragraph block). End with:

**The Experience:** [link]  
**The Blueprints:** [link]

**Hashtags (end of caption or first comment):**  
`#Vibelandia #RenoForVibers #TheGreatReveal #PostSingularity`

---

## 7. HOW TO USE YOUR TOP V's IN CONTENT

- **Spotlight posts:** “Meet one of our top V's” — short story, quote, or photo (with permission). Ties their identity to VIBELANDIA! and Baller V / Golden Backstage.
- **Stories:** Repost their stories when they mention you/Reno/VIBELANDIA (with permission). “Another V who gets it.”
- **Testimonial / quote graphics:** One slide per V. “Top V's already here. [Quote] — [Name].”
- **DM to post:** When a top V says something great, ask: “Can I share this on the grid?” Then post with their handle and a CTA to The Experience or Office Hours.
- **Golden Backstage angle:** “The people you see in my Office Hours and at the club — many are top V's. Golden Backstage is for them.”
