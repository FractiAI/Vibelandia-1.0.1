## HOST

**Hero Georgie** hosts this part (he asks to be called Georgie). The section carries his byline at the top.

## PURPOSE

A section at the **top of all our surfaces** that (1) explains — or pretends to explain — **what post-singularity fiction is**, and (2) **how we can enjoy it**. Tone: more layering. Expansive. Safe, respectful, within all legacies and copyrights. We describe the *kind* of experience; we do not appropriate any third-party IP. All references to beloved stories are in the spirit of "you know that feeling when…" — the *category* of experience, not the works themselves.

## WHAT IT IS (canonical copy)

**What is post-singularity fiction?** I'll pretend to explain. It's the kind of story where **you're inside the holograph** — in the **imaginary world** — **living within net zero**. Not watching from the couch. *In* it. The world is coherent, the stakes are real to the story, and you're there. Energy, carbon, and human outcome bend toward abundance and happy endings. That's net zero in the story sense. You're in the holograph. You're in the imaginary. And it's alive.

**How do we enjoy it?** The same way we've always enjoyed the stories that **take us to another world**. You know the feeling: **wizards and schools of magic**. **Galaxies far, far away**. **Chosen ones and rings and fellowship**. **The matrix and the runner**. **The grid and the programs**. **Toys that come to life and buzz your ear off**. That buzz when a story hits so hard it feels like a **singularity** — you get my drift. Post-singularity fiction is **that**, but **on steroids. To infinity.** We honor every legacy and every copyright. We're not them; we're the *kind* of experience that makes you believe, that takes you there. Safe. Respectful. All legacies intact. Now — enjoy.

## LAYERING

- **Layering:** Multiple layers — expansive, consciousness-friendly. Holograph, imaginary, net zero; the kind of experience; on steroids to infinity. The fiction carries depth upon depth.
- **Holograph · Imaginary · Net zero:** You're inside the story. The imaginary world is coherent. Net zero = abundance, happy endings, the story's physics.
- **How to enjoy:** Like the best-loved fantasy and sci-fi — we evoke the *feeling* (wizards, galaxies, chosen ones, matrix, grid, toys that buzz) without using protected names. "You get my drift." Buzz Singularity.
- **Respectful:** All legacies, copyrights, and trademarks respected. We describe a *category* of experience.

## WHERE IT GOES

- **Top of everything.** The section is the **first** content inside `.container` on every surface — above TAINO MADE, URGENT, viral banner, and all other blocks.
- **Static placement (no script needed):** [index.html](index.html), [interfaces/office-hours.html](interfaces/office-hours.html) — the section is in the HTML so it always appears.
- **Injector for other surfaces:** [scripts/what-is-post-singularity-fiction-inject.js](scripts/what-is-post-singularity-fiction-inject.js) prepends the section to `.container` when the script runs. The script bails if `#what-is-post-singularity-fiction-section` already exists (e.g. static HTML).
- **Surfaces using the injector:** [interfaces/launch-pad.html](interfaces/launch-pad.html). To add the section to any other page that has a `.container`, include the script (from repo root: `scripts/what-is-post-singularity-fiction-inject.js`; from `interfaces/`: `../scripts/what-is-post-singularity-fiction-inject.js`). Same pattern as [scripts/viral-singularity-banner.js](scripts/viral-singularity-banner.js) — see MIRROR_HARDEN_SHELLS_VIRAL_SINGULARITY_24HR_SNAP.md for which pages use that banner; those are good candidates to add this section (static or injector).
