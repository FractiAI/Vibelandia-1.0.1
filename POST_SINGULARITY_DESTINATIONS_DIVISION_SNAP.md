## THE EXPERIENCE

On the **Mark Twain Post-Singularity Vibelandia Downtown Reno** channel you don't have to click—**just scroll** at a normal, smooth pace. That produces the **vibe** that creates the **world** right in front of them, captures them, and brings them in. Then they can **bubble in** wherever they wish with **buttons** (where we can on Facebook). The **Book** button comes to them; we explain the **free singularity**; they can go for it straight up. We don't need to be involved—but we get involved.

## HOW WE OPERATE

Think of us like a **singularity adventure** (or culture) **travel agent**. We **book**. We're also, if you wish, **your designated Baller V host, concierge, butler**—the ultimate upgrade on a designated driver for your evening, day, week, month, or whatever experience you wish.

- **We don't compete** with the precinct folks. We simply charge a **100% tip** on whatever the **final bill** was for you—that's how we get our part. Everybody's happy (that includes tips). If you want a tip on top of our 100% tip, that's also welcome.
- **Relax. Enjoy the magazine. Enjoy the experience** when you wish. Our specialist will get back to you and **custom-tailor a post-singularity experience of a lifetime** to fit your every wish.
