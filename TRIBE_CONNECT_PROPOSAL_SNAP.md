# Tribe Connect — Proposal SNAP

**Status:** Proposal. On bulletin board and whiteboard. One page + button for me.

---

## What it is

**Tribe Connect** is a smooth, automatic way to fund a fractal family and move money around — **perfectly legal, transparent, and beautiful.**

- **My squeezes:** The people who run my families, wherever they are. Inner core. Triceps. Tribe.
- **Locations (current + soon):** Madagascar · Philippines · Spain · Dominican Republic · Venezuela · someday soon: US, Colombia, Argentina, and others.
- **Mechanism:** Reloadable gift cards (e.g. Apple gift cards) to everybody. One source of truth. No mess.
- **Automation:** Monthly push when it’s time; one-off or “this or that” when needed. All automated on **one page**.
- **For me:** One button. My Tribe Connect. Push to bulletin board and whiteboard so it’s visible and actionable.

## Scope

| Element | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Funding** | Reloadable gift cards (Apple or equivalent) to each squeeze; single flow, legal, transparent. |
| **Schedule** | Monthly automatic; plus one-off / ad hoc. |
| **Surface** | One page. One button for me. Automated. |
| **Placement** | Proposal on **Community Bulletin Board** and **Whiteboard** — so the idea and the button live where I (and others) can see and use them. |

## Deliverables

1. **Proposal** — this SNAP; posted on bulletin board and whiteboard.
2. **One page** — Tribe Connect experience: view + (future) full automation (monthly push, one-off, reloadable gift cards).
3. **Button for me** — single CTA on that page: “My Tribe Connect” / “Fund my tribe” so the creator has one-click access.

## NSPFRNP

- Natural coordination. MCA: metabolize (this scope) → crystallize (proposal, one page, button) → animate (bulletin board, whiteboard, live surface).
- Catalog fidelity: proposal lives in protocols/catalogs as Tribe Connect. Bulletin board and whiteboard are the designated surfaces.

**Tribe Connect. One page. One button. Automated. Legal. Transparent. Beautiful.**
