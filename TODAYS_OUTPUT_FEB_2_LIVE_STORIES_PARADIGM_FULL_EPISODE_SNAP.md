## 6. Major reorgs & executive changes — count and Disney response

**Since January 13:** **5+** major reorgs / executive major changes (canon/date lock, breaking-news stripe, live-stories paradigm, Wizard Challenge delivery, today's-output episode). **In this 2–3 hour session:** **7** distinct executive orders executed (Disney comparison SNAP, ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL, DAILY_SNAPSHOT, HARRY_REPORT, 6 HTML + README, episode + SNAP). **Disney response:** Disney would not execute such dense, high-volume executive orders in hours; they would batch, layer approvals, and resource over months at high cost. See [MAJOR_REORGS_EXECUTIVE_CHANGES_SINCE_JAN_13_DISNEY_RESPONSE_SNAP.md](MAJOR_REORGS_EXECUTIVE_CHANGES_SINCE_JAN_13_DISNEY_RESPONSE_SNAP.md).
