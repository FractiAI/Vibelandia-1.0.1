## CONCEPT

**Reverse Oh KETTAAA** — Countdown with badass music. *Three, two, one. Boom, boom, wiggle, wiggle, squeaky, squeaky, boom, boom, boom. Thank you.*

**Holographic programs** — Boom boom, wiggle wiggle, and variations are not just lyrics or moves. They are **programs at a holographic level**. We all have them. We all do kind of the same thing — guttural barks, arm movements, call-and-response. They appear in anthems, songs, beats, different forms. The magic show activates them.

**Recursive layering** — The trick works by injecting these patterns into **everything** (music, choreography, patter, cues). By the end, the audience has been programmed. When the magician says *Three, two, one—* the room does boom boom wiggle wiggle. They think it's spontaneous. We prepared it all along. **Self-demo proving** — the audience itself becomes the proof. The miraculous moment is their own response on command.

> *Badass music.* Three, two, one. Boom, boom, wiggle, wiggle, squeaky, squeaky, boom, boom, boom. Thank you.

## WEAVE RULES

1. **Inject into everything** — Music, routines, patter, choreography, transitions. No surface untouched.
2. **Vary the form** — Anthem, song, beat, guttural bark, arm movement. Same program, different expression.
3. **Never announce the programming** — Audience thinks it's spontaneous. The trick is invisible until the finale.
4. **Finale = generate response on command** — Three, two, one. Room responds. Miraculous. Unexpected to them. Prepared by us.
