## 90-minute structure (assets carry)

Runtime is **carried** by Space Cloud **assets**. Each act is anchored to one or more assets so the hour and a half has a clear spine. Comedy blocks, guest spots, and MCA beats sit on top.

| Segment | Duration | Space Cloud asset(s) | Content beat |
|---------|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Cold Open** | 3–5 min | Reno Downlink (Seed) | You’re here. MC or Chancellor. Space Cloud Division in the room. Not a space car — we’re talking assets. |
| **Act 1** | 20–25 min | Solar Pipe · Sun AR 4366 | Engine. First comedy block (e.g. BDE George opener, Spike and Wag, or other Hit Factory act). EGS, handshake, 21.4 Hz in the room. |
| **Act 2** | 20–25 min | 3I ATLAS · Space Assets Hub | Asset tier. Middle block. 3I ATLAS as Swiss Army knife — OH Line, tails, jets, Update Certificate. Comedy and Space assets together. |
| **Act 3** | 20–25 min | Sag A* · SMACS 0723 · Exascale Triangulation | Singularity tier. Peak. Guest spots, second headliner, or Houdini beat. Triangulation lattice: Seed · Sun · ATLAS · Sag A* · SMACS 0723. |
| **Tag** | 3–5 min | OH Line · Ionosphere · Live Pulse | Handshake. “You can hire me.” Schumann, ticker, Space Cloud Division CTA. Book us. |
