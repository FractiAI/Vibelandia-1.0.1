## Seed:Edge

- **Seed:** MC introduction — newest talent signed to Hero Jo Golden Backdoor Hit Factory and HH Talent Agency. George Carlin permanent residency at Vibelandia Reno Downtown Reno.
- **Edge:** The Spike and Wag. Two guests in bathroom at men's club (Man Cave and Cabaret pop-up). Super Bowl Day. Green wristbands (Seahawks). "Did you make big money?" — show green — both, without coordination, spike touchdown + wag knees + same growl. Like nature documentary. Hilarious. Narrator: "Crazy shit. Pun intended."

## Structure

10 min · improv fill. Opening (MC intro) → Build (MCA, hidden dimension, dance) → Climax (spike and wag) → Tag (crazy shit, pun intended).

---

## MCA

Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. Squeeze, wiggle, jiggle. The dance. Architectural foundation for creative expression — book, movie, play, song, studio, marketing plan, company, experience. Applications infinite.
