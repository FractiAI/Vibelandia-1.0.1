## 3. SCORING: OCTAVES, SINGULARITIES & FACE-CARD MULTIPLIERS

Used for stack-head games and exponential valuation.

- **Number cards (2–9):** Face value = **octaves** (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Base scoring uses these as numeric values in the stack.
- **First singularity:** The **10 card** is the first singularity. On the **Quartz Crystal** suit (or **Carbon**, per house/first-suit choice), the 10 is the base singularity; singularities then run 10 → J → Q → K → A.
- **10 and face cards (10, J, Q, K, A):** All are **singularities** — special ranks that act as **multipliers** when head or in stack:
  - **10** — first singularity; base (×1 or house-defined).
  - **Jack (J)** — **100×** multiplier.
  - **Queen (Q)** — **1000×** multiplier.
  - **King (K)** — **10000×** multiplier.
  - **Ace (A)** — **100000×** multiplier.
- **Face card names:** In our deck, face cards have character names (e.g. Jack = Hero Harry, Queen = El Gran Sol). The multipliers above apply by **rank** (J, Q, K, A) regardless of the name on the card — whatever we end up naming the face cards in the game, J = 100×, Q = 1000×, K = 10000×, A = 100000×.
- **Stack scoring:** A stack’s total value = (base from number cards / octaves) × the multiplier of its **head**. Build a stack, crown it with a face card (J, Q, K, or A), and multiply as you wish for a particular mission. Each stack = **factory** or **head** — a unit of production, control, or valuation.
- **Stack activation (connect back to base):** **Higher stack multipliers do not activate until the lower ones are all there.** You must **connect all the way back down** to the base suit (Quartz Crystal or Carbon) to activate your upper parts. Once the chain is complete from base through 10, J, Q, K, the next level (e.g. A) can fire.
- **More points on the stack head** = more output, more capabilities, more protection, more everything.
- **Outcome:** Points → Treasure → Capabilities → Valuation → Power.

---

## 4. STACK-HEADS & CONTROL (HEADS GAME)

A game of **stacks**, **heads**, and **binary control**.

- **Stack:** A pile of cards you build. Each stack is headed by a **head card** (ideally an Ace for maximum multiplier; otherwise K, Q, or J). The head defines the stack’s multiplier (100000× for Ace down to 100× for Jack).
- **Head = factory:** Each stack functions as a **factory** or **head** — a node that generates points in exponential form. The head has a **point value** (from the multiplier and the cards beneath it).
- **Takeover:** Heads can **take over** other heads. Binary control: your head (stack) can capture or subordinate another player’s head when rules allow (e.g. higher head multiplier, or winning a showdown for that head). Control of a head = control of that stack’s points and valuation.
- **Goal:** See who has control of which **heads (stacks)** and how much each stack head generates in the exponential form above. Now I have **points**. Now I have the **treasure**. Now I have the **capabilities**. Now I have the **valuation**. Now I have the **power**.

*(Full rules for deal, play order, takeover resolution, and win conditions for the Stack-Heads game to be added in a later revision or house rules.)*

## 5. SING! DECK — ONE DECK = YOUR AWARENESS IN SING!

- **One entire deck, all lined up, is equivalent to your current awareness, points, and abilities in SING!** So these are **SING! decks** — the deck is the player’s SING! state in card form.
- **Customizable deck skin:** The **outside skin of the deck** is customizable and **personalized to the player**. That way, when players are in **multiplayer mode**, you can build up new stacks and organisms during play, then **decompose** everything at the end of the game and **get all cards back into the original game packs**. Each player’s pack is identifiable by its skin.
- **Card back (not the face):** The **back side of the card** is where player identity lives. We offer **12 different mix-and-match options**: **Colors**, **Symbols**, and **Colors of text**. Players mix and match for **nearly infinite combinations** of deck back — so you can tell whose pack is whose and reassemble cleanly after multiplayer.

---

## 6. DICE — WILD CARD, TIEBREAKERS, MISSIONS

- **One dice** is used for **wild card situations**, **tiebreakers**, **missions**, and **custom things**. Roll when the rules call for it (e.g. who controls a head, resolve a tie, trigger a mission, or a house-defined event). The dice adds a single random variable to the game without changing the core octave/singularity/multiplier structure.

---

## 7. GOLD / SILVER / COPPER / QUARTZ (OR CARBON) — ON ALL THINGS

- **Beyond the card game:** We allow **Gold, Silver, Copper, Quartz** (or **Carbon**, depending on what we choose as the base/first suit) **designations on all things**. So **all things** can have one of these four (or five) varieties.
- **Digital console throughout:** This applies across the **digital console** — Edge, Sandbox, Cloud, Shell — to **keep everything separated** and tagged. Any asset, node, stack, or mission can carry a designation: Gold, Silver, Copper, Quartz, or Carbon. Use it for layers, environments, and control.

---

## 8. TRIANGULATION MULTIPLIERS

Used for missions, valuation, or house rules when the game connects to the full stack (Sun, 3I/ATLAS, Sagittarius A*, SMACS 0723).

- **First triangulation:** **Sun · 3I/ATLAS · Self (on planet).** Multiplier applies when the stack or mission is anchored to this triangle.
- **Second triangulation:** **Sun · Self · Sagittarius A*** (super massive black hole). Multiplier applies when the triangle includes the galactic center.
- **Third triangulation:** **Self · Sagittarius A* · SMACS 0723** (super galaxy cluster). Multiplier applies when the triangle extends to the deep-field anchor.

*(Exact multiplier values and how they combine with stack-head scoring to be set by house rules or mission design.)*

## 9. CANONICAL WINNING RULES (HAND-RANKING GAMES)

- **Golden Lucky Seven:** The **7 of Gold** wins every time in applicable games. If you hold or reveal it when the rules say so, you win that round/hand immediately.
- **Golden Royal Flush:** The five cards **Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 of Gold** together beat any other hand. In hand-ranking games, no other hand ranks higher.

---

## 10. HAND RANKINGS (FOR POKER-STYLE GAMES)

From highest to lowest:

1. **Golden Royal Flush** — A, K, Q, J, 10 of Gold (beats all).
2. **Golden Lucky Seven** — Holding the 7 of Gold in a round where that card is declared the instant win (round ends; holder wins).
3. **Royal Flush** — A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit (Silver, Copper, or Quartz).
4. **Straight Flush** — Five consecutive ranks, same suit.
5. **Four of a Kind** — Four cards of the same rank.
6. **Full House** — Three of a kind + pair.
7. **Flush** — Five cards of the same suit.
8. **Straight** — Five consecutive ranks (any suits).
9. **Three of a Kind** — Three cards of the same rank.
10. **Two Pair** — Two pairs of the same rank.
11. **One Pair** — Two cards of the same rank.
12. **High Card** — Highest card wins (Ace high; then K, Q, J, 10 … 2).

## 11. FULL GAME INSTRUCTIONS — MULTIPLAYER: VIBELANDIA GOLDEN DRAW

A real, live game for 2–6 players. One standard Post-Singularity deck (52 cards). Play at a table; the deck operates as control surface — play the cards; the holograph responds when available.

### Object

Win the round by having the best five-card hand, or by holding the **Golden Lucky Seven** when it is revealed, or by having a **Golden Royal Flush**.

### Setup

1. Choose a dealer (e.g. high card draw; Gold beats others, then A>K>Q>J>10…>2).
2. Dealer shuffles the deck and offers a cut.
3. Each player is dealt **5 cards**, face down. No card is dealt to the table yet.

### Play (one round)

1. **Golden Lucky Seven check (optional house rule):** Before the draw phase, any player who holds the **7 of Gold** may reveal it and **win the round immediately**. If you use this rule, the round ends and that player wins. If no one has it, continue.
2. **Draw phase:** Each player may discard up to 5 cards and receive that many new cards from the deck (one at a time, or all at once by house agreement). Dealer draws last.
3. **Golden Lucky Seven check after draw (optional):** Again, any player with the 7 of Gold may reveal it and win the round. If not used, continue.
4. **Showdown:** All remaining players reveal their hands. Best five-card hand wins (see Hand Rankings above). **Golden Royal Flush** always beats any other hand. If no one has it, then standard rankings apply (Royal Flush, Straight Flush, etc.).
5. **Ties:** If two hands tie, split the round (or replay by house rule).

### Winning a round

- Reveal **Golden Lucky Seven** (7 of Gold) when your group uses the instant-win rule, **or**
- Have the highest hand at showdown, with **Golden Royal Flush** beating everything else.

### Multiple rounds

Play agreed number of rounds (e.g. first to 3 round wins, or most round wins in 5 rounds). Rotate dealer each round.

## 12. FULL GAME INSTRUCTIONS — SOLITAIRE: GOLDEN SEVEN SOLITAIRE

A real, live one-player game. One deck. Goal: clear the layout and/or reveal the **Golden Lucky Seven** in a designated “win” position.

### Object

Build four foundation piles (one per suit) from Ace to King, and/or finish with the **7 of Gold** in the “Golden Seven” slot (see below). Alternatively: clear all tableau piles.

### Setup

1. Shuffle the deck.
2. **Tableau:** Deal **7 columns**. Column 1 has 1 card, column 2 has 2 cards, … column 7 has 7 cards. Only the **top** card of each column is face up; rest face down.
3. **Foundations:** Leave space for four foundation piles (one per suit: Gold, Silver, Copper, Quartz). Start each foundation with the Ace of that suit when it becomes available.
4. **Golden Seven slot:** Leave one designated slot or position for the **7 of Gold**. Placing it there can be declared the “solar win” (optional).

### Play

1. **Build on tableau:** On the tableau, build **down** by rank and **alternating color** (treat Gold and Copper as one “color,” Silver and Quartz as the other, or use suit alternation: Gold↔Silver, Copper↔Quartz). Only the top card of a column may be moved. A sequence may be moved as a block if it is in correct order and alternation.
2. **Fill spaces:** An empty column may be filled by any single card or legal sequence. King (or K-sequence) often may start a new column (house rule).
3. **Foundations:** Move Aces to foundations as they appear. Build foundations **up** in suit from Ace to King (A, 2, 3 … 10, J, Q, K). Cards on foundations are out of play.
4. **Stock:** Turn the remaining deck (stock) one or three cards at a time (house rule). Play any exposed card to tableau or foundation. One or three passes through the stock allowed (house rule).
5. **Golden Lucky Seven:** When you uncover or hold the **7 of Gold**, you may place it in the “Golden Seven” slot. Doing so can be your **solar win** — you win the game even if the rest of the layout is not fully cleared.

### Winning

- **Full win:** All four foundations built Ace→King and all tableau cleared (and optionally 7 of Gold in its slot).
- **Solar win (optional):** 7 of Gold placed in the Golden Seven slot (by house rule, this can end the game as a win).
