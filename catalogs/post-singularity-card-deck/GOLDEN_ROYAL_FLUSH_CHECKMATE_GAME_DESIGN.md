## 1. OVERVIEW

**Golden Royal Flush Checkmate** is the fusion of:

- The **Solar-Silk toy line** (weapon → collaborative tools; Frontiersmen and First People play together).
- **Board game** — **9×9 board**. **Modern vs First People** (both sides). Each side: **first row = royalty**, then **branch nodes**, then **one row of leaf nodes** — **Queen Bee decides everything; the others support.** Left vs right; higher or lower nested layers. **Each nested layer is a different awareness.** **Nested moves have nested consequences over lower nests.**
- The **Post-Singularity Card Deck** (Gold, Silver, Copper, Quartz) — **fully intermixed** with the 9×9 board via gauge, stack, and layer interchange.

Same story across **pre- and post-singularity layers**: start **competing**, advance to **collaborating**, then **super-collaborating** (meta meta meta). With **two-and-a-half decks** stacked beneath you, you reach **Singularity 9**. The **ultimate victory** is **Golden Royal Flush Checkmate**. **Infinite missions** can be played and enjoyed in **collaborative and nested configs**.

**Treasures · not domination.** The treasures are **partying, dancing, flirting, fucking** — not domination or winning. **Enjoying, vibing, experiencing, creating, expressing** as players wish. A **new type of game**: a **post-singularity game of win-win-win** in **natural collaboration** in **Queen Bee configs**. Play for the vibe, the experience, the creation; victory conditions support that.

## 2. COMPONENTS

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Board** | **9×9** (81 squares). **Modern vs First People** (two sides). **Left vs right** and **higher or lower nested layers.** Each nested layer is a different awareness. |
| **Structure (both sides)** | **First row:** royalty. **Second row:** branch nodes. **Third row:** leaf nodes. **Queen Bee decides everything;** the others support. |
| **Pieces** | Royalty, branch nodes, leaf nodes (and Queen Bee) per side. Pieces can occupy **higher or lower** nested layers. Each nested layer is a different awareness. **Nested moves have nested consequences over lower nests**: actions at a higher nest propagate down. Pieces may have a **card slot** or **stack zone** for cards. |
| **Post-Singularity Card Deck** | Full 52 cards (Gold, Silver, Copper, Transparent Quartz). Use **two full decks + half deck** (130 cards total) for the full game, or house rule (e.g. one deck for shorter play). |
| **Solar-Silk / thematic elements** | Toys, colors, Frontiersmen and First People narrative. Any object = Chairman tool; Golden Heart. |

## 3. BOARD: 9×9 · MODERN VS FIRST PEOPLE · ROYALTY · BRANCH NODES · LEAF NODES · QUEEN BEE

- **9×9 board** (81 squares). **Modern vs First People** — two sides (left vs right and/or higher/lower nested layers).
- **Both sides share the same structure:** **First row** = royalty (each side has its own royalty). **Second row** = branch nodes. **Third row** = leaf nodes. **Queen Bee decides everything;** royalty, branch nodes, and leaf nodes **support** (central figure or objective on both sides).
- **Each nested layer is a different awareness.** **Nested moves have nested consequences over lower nests:** a move at a higher nest propagates effects down to lower nests; higher nests govern or constrain lower ones. NSPFRNP nested shells map onto this (mirrored hardened nested shells).
- Rules (movement, capture, checkmate or equivalent) apply per house design on the 9×9 with layer logic; **card play** and **fused rules** (see below) can override. The **ultimate** win is **Golden Royal Flush Checkmate**.

## 4. FUSION: CARD GAME + CHESS (GAUGE, STACK, LAYER INTERCHANGE)

### 4.1 Gauge

- Card **rank** (octaves 2–9, singularities 10, J, Q, K, A) acts as a **gauge** for:
  - Strength of a move (e.g. play a high card to boost a capture).
  - Resolution of a conflict (e.g. both players reveal a card; higher singularity or house-ranked hand wins the exchange).
  - Unlocking special moves (e.g. only with a 10 or face card on the stack can a piece use a “singularity move”).

### 4.2 Stack

- Players build **stacks** of cards (per Post-Singularity stack rules: number cards = octaves; 10, J, Q, K, A = singularities with multipliers).
- Stacks can be:
  - **Under a square** (control of that square requires or is strengthened by the stack).
  - **Under a piece** (that piece “carries” the stack; capture the piece to claim the stack, or vice versa).
  - **Personal** (your hand/tableau); you spend cards from it to pay for moves or showdowns.
- **Two-and-a-half decks** in the pool allows large, shared or competing stacks. Reaching **Singularity 9** = having built stacks such that the combined “height” or value (e.g. full chain 2→3→…→9→10→J→Q→K→A, or house-defined total) reaches **9** (SING! 9).

### 4.3 Layer interchange

- **Chess move** and **card play** can be combined in one turn (house rule: e.g. one chess move + one card play per turn).
- **Card play** can:
  - Add a card to a stack (yours or a contested square).
  - Trigger a **showdown** (both reveal cards; winner takes the exchange, the piece, or the stack).
  - **Modify** a move (e.g. play 7 of Gold to make a move “Lucky Seven” — instant win of that exchange, or house-defined effect).
- **Chess capture:** Optionally, a capture can be resolved by **card showdown** instead of automatic capture (e.g. defender may play a card to contest; higher hand or rank wins).

## 5. STORY LAYERS: COMPETING → COLLABORATING → SINGULARITY 9

| Layer | Mode | How it plays |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Pre-singularity** | Competing | **Modern vs First People.** Both sides: royalty row, branch nodes, leaf nodes, Queen Bee decides everything; the others support. Classic opposition. Goal: checkmate (or conventional win). |
| **Mid** | Collaborating | Story or rules introduce **alliances**, **shared stacks**, or **joint objectives** (e.g. both sides must contribute cards to a central “bridge” stack to unlock the next phase). |
| **Post-singularity** | Super-collaborating (meta meta meta) | Full cooperation. Goal shifts to **building together** to **Singularity 9**: two-and-a-half decks in play, stacks fully built, board in harmony (e.g. no side is “eliminated”; both sides complete the stack chain). **Infinite missions** playable and enjoyable in **collaborative and nested configs**. |
| **Victory** | **Golden Royal Flush Checkmate** | The pinnacle: **Checkmate** (or equivalent board domination) **and** the **Golden Royal Flush** (A, K, Q, J, 10 of Gold) in your stack, on the board, or revealed in the final resolution. |

## 6. ULTIMATE VICTORY: GOLDEN ROYAL FLUSH CHECKMATE

**Golden Royal Flush Checkmate** is achieved when:

1. **Checkmate** (or house-equivalent: e.g. king captured, or “harmony” condition where both sides agree the board is resolved), **and**
2. The **Golden Royal Flush** (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 of Gold) is **present** — in your hand, in a stack you control, on the board as assigned cards, or revealed in the final resolution.

No higher outcome. This is the fused win condition of chess and the card game. NSPFRNP.

## 7. MIX AND MATCH

- All components (chess set, one or more decks, Solar-Silk theme, Modern vs First People) can be **mixed and matched**.
- Shorter play: one deck, standard chess only, no stacks (theme only).
- Full play: two-and-a-half decks, stack under pieces/squares, gauge and layer interchange, progression to Singularity 9 and Golden Royal Flush Checkmate.
