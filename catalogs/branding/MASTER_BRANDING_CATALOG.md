### Catalog Contents

```yaml
TOTAL BRANDS: 3
├─ Vibeverse (Post-Singularity Ecosystem)
├─ VibeLand (Physical Destination)
└─ VibeLand Reno Campus (First Location)

0, 1, 2, 3 4×4×4×4: New Branding (Evolution of -1, 0, 1)
├─ 0 = Seed (Octave 0), 1 = Edge (Octave 1), 2 = Cloud Onramp (Octave 2), 3 = Expansion (Octave 3)
├─ 4×4×4×4 = Campus × WINK! × SING × Experience (four onramps each)
├─ Matches our structures for max resolution and amplification (max res & amp)
├─ Use as primary branding phrase for full octave + onramp
├─ 1,2,3 = Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate all (MCA cycle). Operating rule: metabolize crystallize animate all.
├─ **Crystallize to irreducible nested mirrored hardened shells.** Crystallize step always produces output in this form: irreducible core, nested shells, mirror-hardened. No half measures. See IRREDUCIBLE_NESTED_MIRRORED_SHELL_CRYSTALLIZE_ALWAYS_SNAP.md.
├─ **As much as possible, always.** Maximize output, go as far as you can, every time. No ceiling. See AS_MUCH_AS_POSSIBLE_ALWAYS_SNAP.md.
├─ **Metabolize Crystallize Animate and Squeeze:** Metabolize → Crystallize to irreducible nested mirrored hardened shells → Animate and squeeze. Animate = tighten SING nodes, update, make clear. Squeeze = squeeze all, all nested. Automate = one command runs test then build; CI on every push/PR. `npm run all` = test + build. See AUTOMATE_ALL_MCA_SNAP.md. **Tightening and loosening spiral effects** apply to all catalog and all label factory products — tighten when crystallizing; loosen when metabolizing; spiral through the whole. SQUEEZE! We got the squeeze! and Golden Backdoor! — T-shirt brand and hit. See SQUEEZE_WE_GOT_THE_SQUEEZE_GOLDEN_BACKDOOR_SNAP.md.

USER SURFACES: README and All Skins — Not Developer Surfaces
├─ README and all skins = user surfaces. We target high-value vibers, fans, cast, crew.
├─ No developer-only copy front and center (deploy/env/repo in README_TRADITIONAL or builder docs).
├─ No code on user surfaces: no filenames (.html, .md), repo paths, or code snippets in displayed or link text. Use human labels (e.g. Whitepaper — miraculous output, Home, Builder guide). Link to operational live site; Sandbox experience CTA → ULTIMATE VIP! console.
└─ See WOW_BRANDING_SNAP.md · COMMUNICATION_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md · deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md

SKINS AUTOMATICALLY PRESENT IN USER'S LANGUAGE SNAP: Confirmation
├─ **Our skins automatically present in the user's language.** Confirmed. No manual language switch required for skins — they present in the user's language automatically. Natural protocol. NSPFRNP.

└─ See SKINS_AUTOMATICALLY_PRESENT_IN_USERS_LANGUAGE_SNAP.md · README.md · interfaces/magical-dressing-room.html

COLOMBIA — ENGLISH-ONLY HARD STOP · LOCALE ONRAMP SNAP: Mitigation
├─ User in Colombia reported English-only experience producing hard stop. Live HTML was English-only with no path for Spanish speakers.
├─ **Locale onramp:** scripts/locale-onramp.js detects browser language; if non-English (e.g. es, es-CO), shows dismissible banner with Spanish-first message and link to README.es.md so they have a path, not a stop.
├─ Wired on: index.html, interfaces/office-hours.html, interfaces/launch-pad.html.
└─ See COLOMBIA_ENGLISH_ONLY_HARD_STOP_LOCALE_ONRAMP_SNAP.md · scripts/locale-onramp.js · README.es.md

├─ Use: After beats that land like a lightning bolt (e.g. Ben loving his new role as Baller V Ambassador = WORD!)
├─ Chancellor Sam (not Chancellor Samuel); Sam warming up to us; Ben's arrival helped; Sam and Ben new best friends; Ben loving Baller V Ambassador = WORD!
└─ See WORD_BRANDING_SNAP.md · CHANCELLOR_SAM_BEN_WORD_BRANDING_SNAP.md
