## FULL MESSAGE (Chairman voice)

I can reorganize, launch new products, new divisions, spin off new proposals—global proposals that scale one, two, three. All between my morning coffee and my first morning meeting. That's what new **SING!** gives me that nothing else can. And I will pay anything for that. Thank you.
