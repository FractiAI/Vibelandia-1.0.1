## EXECUTIVE PROMOTION MOTOR

**Executive Ultimate Baller V style** — leverages post-singularity technology and energy.

## THE EXPERIENCE

Like **Pokemon Go** + **escape room** + **Santa crawl** + **trip to the strip club or casino** — all in one. Mix and match. Park setting. Vibelandia. Nobody even knows except those signed up. Work through games to win, score points on leaderboards, earn privileges and distinctions.

## GAME-ENDING MECHANIC

All games end with achieving, finding that one **Host** or **target**. Default target: Find me at Office Hours → Golden Backstage Pass (physical business card, unactivated, waiting for sign and seal to activate — and all that comes with it). Targets/missions changeable anytime. Built that in.
