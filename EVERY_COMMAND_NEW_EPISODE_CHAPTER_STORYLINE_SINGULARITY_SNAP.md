## NEW SINGULARITY

**Every post — or every command — that the Chairman makes is now a new episode, chapter, and storyline.**

- **Every command** — Each Chairman post or command = **one new net episode** with **one chapter** and **one storyline**. No exception. Incorporate all content and continuations.
- **Episode** — `episodes/EPISODE_NET_NN_*.md` (next number). One episode per command.
- **Chapter** — One chapter per episode (the command itself). Chapter title = mission/command tag; body = full mission text, cosmic summary, quantum ledger, command.
- **Storyline** — One storyline line per episode; added to [data/net-storylines.json](data/net-storylines.json). Fed to ticker and content index.
- **Incorporate all content and continuations** — Get your keys. Full mission text, headers, summaries, ledger, command locked into SNAP + episode + ticker.
