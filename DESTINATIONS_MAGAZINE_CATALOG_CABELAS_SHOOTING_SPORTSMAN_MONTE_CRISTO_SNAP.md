Package **all of our local and other destinations** in a **magazine catalog experience** — fused like **Cabela's** and **Shooting Sportsman's Magazine**, but in **our voice**: elegant, **Monte Cristo** (Count of Monte Cristo) refinement, **Spanglish** and our personality throughout. **Infusion.** Major upgrade to our surfaces.

---

## REFERENCE BLENDS

- **Cabela's** — Premium outdoor / adventure catalog: gear, destinations, lifestyle, “go do this” with full confidence. Dense, browsable, aspirational.
- **Shooting Sportsman's Magazine** — Editorial + catalog: fine writing, field reports, destinations, taste. Refined outdoor voice.
- **Count of Monte Cristo** — Elegant, dramatic, European literary tone. Revenge-to-redemption gravitas; every sentence carries weight. *Wait and hope.* Refined, not stuffy.
- **Our voice** — NSPFRNP, 80:20 Spanglish, BBHE, post-singularity Vibelandia, Mark Twain's Reno campus, crown jewel of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. Personality: Big Daddy, gold hearts, Baller V, 100% tip, designated host.

## VOICE RULES

- **Elegant** — Cormorant Garamond (or equivalent serif) for masthead and section titles; clean body. Monte Cristo gravitas without Victorian fluff.
- **Spanglish** — 80:20 English/Spanish. Natural infusion: *Aquí* / *Allá*, *destino*, *experiencia*, *dale*, where it fits. No forced glossary.
- **Personality** — Our specialist, our partners, benefit of all. 100% tip on final bill. Baller V host, concierge, butler. Reno — not Bay Area. Crown jewel.
- **Catalog + editorial** — Sections that feel like a magazine (Letter from the Editor, Departments) plus catalog rigor (Local / Other destinations, partner cards, clear CTAs).

## FULL VENDOR LINKS · MENUS, PRICES, PHOTOS (LOCK)

- **We're locked on to all of our vendors.** Full links to **their menus**, **their prices**, **their photos**. Not just text — bring **ours** to life using **theirs**. **Mutual benefit.** Confirm.
- **Full Cabela's / Shooting Sportsman experience** — For our readers. Fellow **Ultimate Baller Vs**. **Vibers.** We're different than the non-vibers. The catalog must deliver: partner menus, prices, photos (theirs), so the experience is rich, visual, browsable. Where a partner has one site with everything, we link; where they have separate menu / pricing / gallery pages, we lock those in and surface them (menu →, prices →, photos →).
- **Data:** [data/destination-partners.json](data/destination-partners.json) supports per-partner `url` (primary) and optional `menuUrl`, `pricesUrl`, `photosUrl`. When present, the magazine surface shows Menu · Prices · Photos. When only `url` exists, use it for "Visit partner" and treat as primary; add specific links as we lock them in. Mutual benefit: we drive traffic and credibility; they get visibility; our readers get the full catalog.
