- **Spanglish** — 80:20 English/Spanish. Natural infusion: *Aquí* / *Allá*, *destino*, *experiencia*, *dale*, where it fits. No forced glossary.
- **Personality** — Our specialist, our partners, benefit of all. 100% tip on final bill. Baller V host, concierge, butler. Reno — not Bay Area. Crown jewel.
- **Catalog + editorial** — Sections that feel like a magazine (Letter from the Editor, Departments) plus catalog rigor (Local / Other destinations, partner cards, clear CTAs).
