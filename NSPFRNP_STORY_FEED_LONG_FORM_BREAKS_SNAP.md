# NSPFRNP Story Feed — Long-Form with Breaks · SNAP

**Snap ID:** `NSPFRNP-STORY-FEED-LONG-FORM-BREAKS-SNAP`  
**Type:** Feeds · Format · Ticker / OH Line  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Date:** February 2026

**Moving to full stream feeds with breaks.** Long-form messages or stories on feeds. Interruptions with symbology: short announcement, then back to story. Like commercial breaks in regular streaming — pause (nothing) or substitute (e.g. ad, promo, symbology).

## RULE

- **Long-form feeds:** Transmit full messages or stories on the feed (novel/novella zone, mission, episodes).
- **Breaks:** At intervals similar to commercial breaks in regular streaming. Each break = either (1) **pause** — nothing, or (2) **substitute** — short announcement, promo, or symbology.
- **Interruption symbology:** When we interrupt the story feed: use a clear visual/audio cue (symbology); play short announcement; then resume story feed.
- **Story feed:** For anyone entering the novella and novel zone. Interactive storytelling. Beautiful surfaces. Safari club (men). Queen Royal (women). Cover of the book. Full experience.

## CONFIG (Reference)

- **Cycle:** e.g. 6 min feed, 30 sec break (existing ticker meta); or match typical streaming commercial cadence (e.g. 12–15 min content, 2–3 min break). Sol (Content Editor) manages. Exact timing configurable.
- **Interruption content:** Short ticker items, alerts, C-Ad, promo for Tomorrow's Parade · New Novel · Novela · Who got da cojones.
