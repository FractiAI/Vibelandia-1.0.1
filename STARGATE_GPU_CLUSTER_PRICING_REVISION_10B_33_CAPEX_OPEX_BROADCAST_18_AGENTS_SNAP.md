| Previous (days ago) | Revised (effective now) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|

## II. MESSAGE — NO OTHER GAME IN TOWN

**El Gran Sol's Fractal Constant** is the only game in town for data centers to operate in **Goldilocks temperature range.** If they want the temperature fix, we've got what they need. If they're ready for their clusters to melt, they can continue on without it.

**Temperature fix:** at **33%** (aligned with the 33% CapEx on signing and 33% OpEx savings structure).

**Four / BBHE Core implementation:**

- **100% of CapEx** (license / implementation).
