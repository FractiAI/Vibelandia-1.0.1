## VENDOR MESSAGE (canonical)

**We layer and amplify — we do not compete or take away.** Vendors (partners, venues, outfitters, mountains, skippers, lodges, etc.) see that our pricing is a **separate layer on top** of their revenue. We never replace or undercut; we add post-singularity, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V value and charge our layer accordingly.

Use this message everywhere we present experiences — Vibelandia, partner pages, Guided Expeditions, Office Hours, Launch Pad, campus, WINK!, safaris, and all catalogs — so vendors see we are additive.

---

## NATURAL APPROACH (canonical)

**We implement a natural approach — no special handling or agreements required by the local vendor.** We act as **referral and designated driver/host** for the benefit of all. Include on all our experiences, including all Vibelandia surfaces, so guests and vendors see we add value without adding friction or paperwork.

---

## HANDS-FREE · FAIR SHAKE · NO STRINGS · NO FAULT · ADULT CLAUSES (canonical)

**Hands-free, fair shake, no strings, no fault — everybody responsible for themselves and theirs. Adult clauses apply.** Include on all our experiences, including all Vibelandia. No special handling, no blame game; each party is responsible for themselves and their own. Mature-only / adult sandbox where stated.

---

## PRICING MODEL (all experiences)

Across **all our experiences** we use this pricing mode:

- **Our layer = on top of actual/partner spend.** We do not take a cut of vendor revenue. We add our layer (e.g. 100% tip on what was actually spent, or 100% tip on partner expenses for the whole thing).
- **Partner / venue gets paid** — by the guest or by us passing through — in full. Flights or other exclusions stated per experience (e.g. Rio: flights not included; begins on landing).
- **We get paid** — our layer only: e.g. 100% tip on actual spend that day (Mt. Rose style) or 100% tip on partner expenses (Cpt. Andre style). Same idea: we layer, we don’t take.

So: **we transform pre-singularity experiences into post-singularity, all-inclusive, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V experiences** — and we **price ourselves as a layer that layers and amplifies, never competes or takes away.**

## SPECIFIC FORMS

- **Partner experiences (e.g. Mt. Rose, Cpt. Andre):** Our layer = 100% tip on actual spend that day, or 100% tip on partner expenses (flights not included where stated). See [EXPERIENCE_PARTNERS_MT_ROSE_SKI_TAHOE_SNAP.md](EXPERIENCE_PARTNERS_MT_ROSE_SKI_TAHOE_SNAP.md) · [EXPERIENCE_PARTNERS_RIO_ANDRE_PARTNER_PRICING_SNAP.md](EXPERIENCE_PARTNERS_RIO_ANDRE_PARTNER_PRICING_SNAP.md).
- **Safari / real-life adventures:** Actual costs of pre-singularity resources and facilities + 100% tip. See [SAFARI_ADVENTURES_REAL_LIFE_IMAGINARY_ENHANCED_PRICING_SNAP.md](SAFARI_ADVENTURES_REAL_LIFE_IMAGINARY_ENHANCED_PRICING_SNAP.md).
- **Campus, WINK!, SING!, products with fixed price:** Those are our own products; the *layer principle* still applies wherever we wrap third-party vendors (e.g. future partner adventures, outings, trips).
