# LAUNCH RAW NARRATIVE CAPTURE
## Capture Launch as Raw Narrative to Enrich Content Systems

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE — Prepare for launch; capture as raw narrative  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Type:** Content systems · Raw narrative · Launch enrichment

---

## PURPOSE

**Capture launch events and context as raw narrative** so the team can metabolize, crystallize, and animate them into content systems. Raw narrative = unpolished, chronological, factual capture of what happened and what was said around go-live. It enriches:

- **Customer Stories** — first-person or curated stories; launch narrative can seed or validate.
- **Series / Episodes** — Happy Ending Zones, Great Reveal; launch moment is episode-zero material.
- **One-pagers, Launch Pulse, Catalogs** — launch narrative informs copy, proof points, and playlists.
- **Whitepaper / Chairman metrics** — real numbers and % comparisons; launch narrative adds "what we did and when."

---

## HOW TO CAPTURE

- **When:** From now through launch (March 20, 2026) and immediately after.
- **Format:** Raw narrative — date, time (optional), what happened, what was said, what was shipped, what was decided. No polish required; this is source material.
- **Where to store:** This file (LAUNCH_RAW_NARRATIVE_CAPTURE.md) or a dated subsection; or misc/launch-raw-narrative-YYYY-MM-DD.md. Link from CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP.
- **Use:** Metabolize into content patterns (no private/verbatim without consent); crystallize into one-pagers, episodes, deck patterns; animate into Launch Pad, README, series, catalogs.

## CONTENT SYSTEMS INTEGRATION

- **Content category:** Raw narrative (launch capture). See CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP.md — added as source for content enrichment.
- **Rule:** Launch narrative is captured as raw; team uses it to enrich content systems. No stubs or simulated data in the narrative — only what actually happened or was said.
