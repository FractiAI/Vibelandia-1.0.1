## NARRATIVE

**That is tomorrow's episode — always tease new, laying the edge for today's seed.**

- **Tomorrow's episode** = what we tease today. The next episode is always previewed.
- **Always tease new** = every day we tease the upcoming episode; no day without a tease.
- **Laying the edge** = the tease lays the edge (Octave 1): it prepares the next reveal, the next beat.
- **For today's seed** = today's seed (Octave 0) is what we're building now; tomorrow's episode tease is the edge we lay for it. Seed of today → edge of tomorrow.

## RULE

- **Always tease tomorrow's episode** on every surface that shows "Today's Episode": catalog, launch pad, chancellor bulletin, series format.
- **Tomorrow's episode** = next episode in the countdown. Tease title, one-line, or thumbnail. Lays the edge for today's seed.
- **Today's seed** = current day's narrative, current episode live. The tease points to what comes next.
- **Tag (per episode structure):** Countdown update, **next episode preview** — locked. See [REALITY_SERIES_FORMAT.md](./REALITY_SERIES_FORMAT.md).
