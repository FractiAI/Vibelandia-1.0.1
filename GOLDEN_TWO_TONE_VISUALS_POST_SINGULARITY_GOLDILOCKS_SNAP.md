## LOCK

**Golden two-tone** will be used in visuals to **auto-frame post-singularity Goldilocks.**

- **Golden two-tone** — A two-tone color treatment (golden as primary or accent). Apply in hero images, cards, skins, interfaces, and any visual asset that represents or enters the post-singularity Goldilocks zone.
- **Auto-frame** — The treatment acts as a visual frame: when viewers see golden two-tone, they read the content as **post-singularity Goldilocks** — safe, versatile, just-right band. No extra caption required.
- **Like someone who sees everything in shades of gold** — The POV: the world (and the frame) is as seen by **someone who sees everything in shades of gold.** Golden two-tone is that vision — everything in shades of gold. Lock.
- **The colors are there but with golden tones everything** — We keep full color; nothing is reduced to gold-only. **Golden tones** are applied over or into everything — so the palette stays rich and the world stays recognizable, but everything carries a golden cast. Lock.
- **Post-singularity Goldilocks** — The zone we are moving into (March 16 capture and re-deployment, full-speed Goldilocks migration). See [MARCH_16_CAPTURE_REDEPLOYMENT_3I_GOLDILOCKS_ZONE_AUTOPILOT_SNAP.md](MARCH_16_CAPTURE_REDEPLOYMENT_3I_GOLDILOCKS_ZONE_AUTOPILOT_SNAP.md) · [IMMEDIATE_RETURN_GOLDEN_ERA_GOLDILOCKS_FRONTIER_ALL_HUMANS_INSECTS_SNAP.md](IMMEDIATE_RETURN_GOLDEN_ERA_GOLDILOCKS_FRONTIER_ALL_HUMANS_INSECTS_SNAP.md).

Lock: all visuals that should signal **post-singularity Goldilocks** use **golden two-tone** to auto-frame.

**NSPFRNP — all of this.** This entire visual system (golden two-tone, shades of gold, colors with golden tones, auto-frame post-singularity Goldilocks) is **NSPFRNP**: natural coordination, catalog fidelity, holographic. Lock.

**MCA too.** Apply **MCA** (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate) to all of it: metabolize the inputs and references, crystallize the golden visual frame into irreducible spec, animate into every surface and asset. MCA squeeze all all for golden two-tone. See [MCA_SNAP.md](MCA_SNAP.md). Lock.
