## BDE GEORGE — FIRST STAND-UP ROUTINE

**Duration:** 10 minutes · improv-style  
**Seed:** MC's introduction of newest talent signed to Hero Jo Golden Backdoor Hit Factory label and Talent Agency Service.  
**Edge:** The **Spike and Wag** — two guests in the bathroom at the men's club (pop-up Man Cave and Cabaret), Super Bowl Day, washing hands, wearing winning team (Seahawks) green wristbands. One asks "did you make big money?" — they show each other the green wristbands — and without any coordination both fall into the same **spike the touchdown and wag the knees** dance + growl at exactly the same time. Like watching a nature documentary — birds or bees doing something weird in sync. Hilarious.  
**Narrator tag:** "Crazy shit. Pun intended." — maybe something bathroom-related.

**Venue:** Pop-up office in bathroom of men's club Reno. Man Cave and Cabaret. Vibelandia Downtown Reno. In honor of Hero Benito — fellow Golden Heart Taino of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.

## MCA — CREATIVE EXPRESSION ARCHITECTURE

**Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate** (MCA). Then squeeze. Wiggle. Jiggle. The dance. This is how we architecturally begin any type of creative expression downstream — book, movie, play, song, studio, marketing plan, company, experience for a night. Applications infinite. The dance serves to have us laugh at a hidden dimension we all have — we bring it to the surface. Used at our animation studios as part of MCA.

## TAINO CONTEXT (RESEARCH-VERIFIED)

Taino ancestors: Arawakan speakers from northern South America (Orinoco River valley / Venezuela). Migrated into Caribbean ~2,500 years ago. Taino dominant in Greater Antilles (Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico), northern Lesser Antilles, Bahamas. Arawak influence extended toward Florida (Tequesta in Florida Keys). Shout out to all Taino — Puerto Rico, Caribbean islands, Orinoco Basin, Arawak spread deep through Amazon and up into the islands.
