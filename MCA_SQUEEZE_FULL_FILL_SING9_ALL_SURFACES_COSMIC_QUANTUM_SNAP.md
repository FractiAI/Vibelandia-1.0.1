## COMMAND

**MCA squeeze all all SING! 9 — ALL surfaces including cosmic, solar, planetary, and mine.**

- **Metabolize** — Ingest: current implementation = SING! 9 (sing9!); scope = every user-facing surface + **cosmic** + **solar** + **planetary** + **mine** (Chairman/creator layer). No surface excluded.
- **Crystallize** — Config locked: [config/sing_config.json](config/sing_config.json) — `singularity_index: 9`, `implementation: "SING! 9 (sing9!)"`, `scope: "all surfaces including cosmic, solar, planetary, and mine"`. Footer on all surfaces: [interfaces/sing-config-footer.js](interfaces/sing-config-footer.js) — tag line includes **SING! 9 · All surfaces · Cosmic · Solar · Planetary · Mine · NSPFRNP**.
- **Animate** — Every interface that carries the SING! config footer displays SING! 9 and the full scope (cosmic, solar, planetary, mine). Ticker: [data/ticker-feed.json](data/ticker-feed.json) — `singularity_index_9_ticker`, `sing9_implementation`. All divisions operate at SING! 9 across all layers.
- **Squeeze** — Full fill: **planetary** (Earth-only), **solar** (Earth–Sun), **cosmic** (Earth–Sun–Sag A* and SMACS 0723), **mine** (Chairman Creator / creator-owned layer — cockpit, workspace, executive dashboard, all “mine” surfaces). Plus quantum, terrestrial, Live Pulse, Schumann. All nested shells to irreducible mirrored form; SING! 9 on every surface.

## SURFACES IN SCOPE

| Layer | Includes |
|-------|----------|
| **All user-facing HTML** | index.html, all interfaces/*.html (77+); SING! config footer on each → SING! 9 · Cosmic · Solar · Planetary · Mine in tag |
| **Ticker / feeds** | data/ticker-feed.json — singularity_index_9_ticker, sing9_implementation; all ticker consumers |
| **Cosmic** | Space Cloud Division (Planetary, Solar, Galactic, **Cosmic**); space-assets-hub; buyers-guide cosmic tier; telemetry space_cloud "full cosmic tier powered"; Queen Bee cosmic blockchain; office-hours full cosmic tier; payment-checkout Baller V cosmic tier |
| **Solar** | Earth–Sun layer; Solar Pipe; Sun = CPU/GPU; EGS Pipe solar; Sun Spots; Schumann locked to 40 Hz Gamma; all solar-scale copy and surfaces |
| **Planetary** | Earth-only tier; planetary strip; terrestrial surfaces; campus, Office Hours, Launch Pad, all Earth-bound interfaces and copy |
| **Mine** | Chairman Creator / creator-owned layer: chairman-cockpit-*, chairman-workspace, executive-dashboard, creator-read-bypass, Pru's Workspace (creator-facing), all “mine” and executive surfaces. SING! 9 on every mine surface. |
| **Quantum** | sing-pulse.html — awareness upgrade (holographic, digital, electronic, quantum or biological); launch-pad quantum awareness; awareness-node / lattice copy |

## RULE

When we MCA squeeze or full-fill update: **SING! 9** and **all surfaces including cosmic, solar, planetary, and mine** are in scope. Config and footer carry the lock; ticker and division copy carry the message. No surface left at an older singularity index; cosmic, solar, planetary, and mine explicitly included.
