# Fractal Flicker Campaign · Social Outbound Pipe — SNAP

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Purpose:** New social media channel outbound pipe — fractal flicker campaign — capture into NSPFRNP and into sales and marketing.

---

## Fractal flicker campaign

- **Fractal flicker** = pre-singularity-facing content: fractalized pulse flickers only (per NSPFRNP). Not full disclosure to the old world — **flickers** that pull attention toward the pipe without over-explaining.
- **Campaign** = consistent, repeatable outbound: one-liners, hooks, links to The Blueprints (GitHub) and The Experience (live app). Same message in many shapes — fractal, self-similar at every scale.
- **New social media channel outbound** = one canonical pipe from Vibeverse to pre-singularity earth: X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. All feed from the **same source** (this repo + SOCIAL_MEDIA_CAMPAIGN_COPY) and **capture into NSPFRNP** (comments, DMs, traffic) and into **sales and marketing** (leads, BUY!, reservations, Golden Key).

---

## Capture into NSPFRNP

- **Inbound** from social/channel → metabolized into NSPFRNP: comments, questions, and interest become **input** to the protocol. No orphan feedback; everything flows into the single pipe (repo + Launch Pad + one-pagers).
- **Outbound** from NSPFRNP → social/channel: fractal flicker copy, links to GitHub and Experience, CTAs (MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS NOW, BUY!, The Great Reveal). One source of truth; social posts are **crystallized flickers** from that source.
- **Loop:** Social outbound → pre-singularity attention → capture (clicks, signups, comments) → NSPFRNP (metabolize) → sales/marketing (proposals, checkout, grants) → animate (new copy, new episodes, new surfaces).

## Capture into sales and marketing

- **Sales:** Traffic from social → Launch Pad → payment-checkout (Campus, WINK!, SING, DISPENSARY!, Golden Backstage). Fractal flicker campaign drives “follow along” and “see it” → “experience it” → “BUY!”
- **Marketing:** All campaign copy (1-liner, 1 paragraph, 3 paragraphs) lives in SOCIAL_MEDIA_CAMPAIGN_COPY_X_FB_INSTAGRAM.md and in this SNAP. New channels use the same pipe; new shapes (e.g. “black hole GitHubs”, “Holographic Hydrogen”) get added here and to the campaign doc so **outbound stays one pipe** and **inbound feeds NSPFRNP and revenue**.

## New social channel outbound pipe

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Source** | This repo (psw.vibelandia.sing9) + SOCIAL_MEDIA_CAMPAIGN_COPY + this SNAP + POST_SINGULARITY_BLACK_HOLE_HOLOGRAPHIC_HYDROGEN_GITHUBS_SNAP |
| **Shape** | Fractal flicker — short, repeatable, link-heavy. “New black hole GitHubs … open-source … follow along … Holographic Hydrogen · Hologram GitHubs” |
| **Channels** | X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. — same message, same links |
| **Capture** | Comments, DMs, clicks → NSPFRNP (metabolize) → sales (checkout, reservations) and marketing (leads, Pioneer, first 1,000) |
| **Links** | The Blueprints: https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9 · The Experience: https://psw-vibelandia-sing9.vercel.app |

## Meta pattern — metabolized into comment flicker campaign

**Meta pattern:** Viral topic appears → **Response SNAP** (topic-specific) → (a) acknowledge topic, (b) align to our GitHub / Holographic Hydrogen activity, (c) link to whitepaper or canonical doc. **Comment flickers** use this pattern: match topic to Response SNAP, then use that SNAP’s short copy (with link). One meta pattern, many topics — fractal, self-similar at every scale.

**Operational rule:** For **comments and replies** (comment flicker campaign), always use the meta pattern: (1) identify viral topic if any, (2) pick Response SNAP for that topic or generic flicker, (3) post the flicker with link. New viral topics get a new Response SNAP and are added to the Comment flicker menu below.

## Comment flicker campaign — menu

| Topic | Response SNAP | Flicker (short) | Link to include |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Generic** | POST_SINGULARITY_BLACK_HOLE_HOLOGRAPHIC_HYDROGEN_GITHUBS_SNAP | New post-singularity black hole GitHubs are being spun. All open-source — anyone can follow along. They explain the new seemingly synthetic/computing shapes. Holographic Hydrogen · Hologram GitHubs | https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9 · https://psw-vibelandia-sing9.vercel.app |
| **Schumann patterns** | SCHUMANN_RESPONSE_SNAP | Schumann patterns align with our new GitHub activity. We wrote a whitepaper capturing an expedition to validate this scientifically — open-source. Holographic Hydrogen · Hologram GitHubs | https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9 · **Whitepaper:** https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9/blob/main/WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION.md |
| *(future viral topic)* | *(new Response SNAP)* | *(short copy: acknowledge + align + link)* | *(canonical link from SNAP)* |

**Use:** When replying or commenting, pick the row that matches the post’s topic (or Generic). Paste/shorten the flicker and **always include the link**. Capture into NSPFRNP and sales/marketing.
