# THREE PARALLEL SERIES — NSPFRNP Catalog

**Superseded by:** [FIVE_PARALLEL_SERIES_NSPFRNP.md](FIVE_PARALLEL_SERIES_NSPFRNP.md) — we now stream **five** parallel series (Happy Ending Zones, Office Hours, Vibin!, Chairman!, WINK!). This doc kept for reference.

**Type:** Series catalog · Three streams concurrent (legacy)  
**Status:** 📦 REFERENCE — see FIVE_PARALLEL_SERIES_NSPFRNP.md  
**Rule:** We now stream **five parallel series**. Very cool.

**Variable length by mission:** Episodes and series runs are **variable length depending on missions**. 60 min / 12,000 words = full rich target when mission warrants; missions can dictate shorter or longer. All three series follow this rule.

**Can append:** Episodes and series runs **can append** — add content to existing episodes or runs over time; extend in place.
