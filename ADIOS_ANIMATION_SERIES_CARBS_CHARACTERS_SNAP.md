## CARB — Main Character (C or B) · Dragon Layer · Analytics

**Carb** — Also known as Carbon, Carb, C or B. **Dragon layer.**

- **Anti-hero car.** Good guy deep down. That toughness comes from having suffered.
- **Origin:** Ostium. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. Big forums. That's where we come from.
- **Vibe:** "I'm a little bit tough on you." Lurking in the shadows. Always patrolling. Always going places.
- **Behavior:** Burning carbs — that's what you do when you're a car. You cruise around. You fart your colors. Turn the car around to see who's showing you the respect you deserve.
- **Time:** 4 o'clock. Burning carbs.
- **Dragon / analytics layer (279 arc):** Always looking to see who's looking. Big farting and blinding headlighting everything and everyone so no one really sees him — except the blinding headlight. They hear him. They smell him. They feel him. Insecure. Pumped up. Bad vibe. **Wrapper.** Inside there's also a golden heart.

## HER — 1963 Ragtop VW Bug · New Arrival · Golden Era · Post-Singularity

**Her** — Pronounced *hhhErrrrrr!* — very heavy guttural German accent. New arrival from the golden era. Walked in on Vibelandia. **Post-singularity version** — all are good, metabolize without the bat; they don't come as one-size-fit-all packaging anymore. Post-singularity Bug.

- **Relic.** Times have passed. But look how well she's weathered. All the stories she tells.
- **Not just any bug.** A convertible. Not just any convertible — one that still works, intact, has made it through all these years. Maybe a little cosmetically restored here and there.
- **1963 ragtop VW.** Candy Apple Red and White two-tone. Like on a 1963 Stingray. Beige rag top. Whitewall tires. Mirror hubs. Matching red and white leather interior. Ivory steering wheel.
- **NOT your average run-of-the-mill Bug.** This one is for a top dog. Sentimental about the old days and the big golden dreams of the big golden era following the Second World War.
- **Backstory:** The Commander's mistress. The real passion. But also the one hidden in the closet/garage.
- **Arrival:** Approached the Chairman on a mission to send beach funds to the tribe (who've been getting restless — *I'm gonna bring home the bison* — and yet he hasn't; they tolerate him despite cause to toss him out with the bathroom pail; yet they haven't). *I'm just a messenger. So Her — welcome to the cast.* Chill. Relax. We're on autopilot here. Vibelandia. Everything is natural systems protocol based. Five star. 24×7. Auto everything. Here's your menu. Decide how you wanna spend your day today and vibe. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia Downtown Reno Campus. We're open for business.

- **Top dog status:** Constantly farting very loud. Very, very loud. To show everybody his top dog status.
- **"It's been such a long time."**
- **Competition:** Everybody competing to see who can fart the loudest. The carbs who can fart loudest get all the lady carbs. That's the way it works.
- **Patrol:** Always lurking around in the shadows. Patrolling. Always going places.
- **Vibe:** Freight train energy. Big headlight. Black cloud. Loud.
