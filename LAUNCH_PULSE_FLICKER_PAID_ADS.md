## 💰 BUDGET: $150 TOTAL

| Platform | Allocation | Use |
|----------|------------|-----|

## 📌 FRAMING — FIRST POST‑SINGULARITY COMMUNITY, TIPPED LAUNCH (NO RENO LEAD)

**Do not lead with downtown Reno.** Lead with:

- **First post‑singularity community**
- **Tipped launch**
- **On‑chain. Sci‑fi game. March 20. Gold hearts.**

Reno can appear on the landing page and in product copy (campus, etc.) but is not the hero of the pulse flicker or ad headlines.
