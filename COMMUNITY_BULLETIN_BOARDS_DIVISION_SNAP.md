## FULL NEW DIVISION

**Community Bulletin Boards** is the post-singularity version of social media. Much richer. Each button is an entire franchise, empire, superhero — as big or small as you wish. Launch your little jewelry business on any button.

**The experience.** Discovering little cards through a community bulletin board is rich and super fun. Standing in front of a rich bulletin board — like at a coffee shop. Cool and curated. *Oh, check this out. Oh, check that out.* You could spend all day on it.

**Richer than social feed.** Each click is a full website — company, novel, episode, song, script, proposal. Not just a post. That's the post-singularity daily bulletin board experience.

**Nest buttons on buttons.** Any button can contain other buttons. Infinite nesting. Franchise within franchise. Empire within empire.

**Groups and teams.** Define groups. Define teams. New richer collaborative vibe-based platform and experience. All tied into Vibelandia.

## STRUCTURE — OFFICE HOURS · AFTER HOURS · AFTER PARTY

| Slot | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Office Hours** | The sandbox. Great. |
| **After Hours** | Cloud Grade. (Not grim.) |
| **After Party** | DA shit. Shell Grade. By invitation only. |

**What qualifies as member only:** WINK! membership · membership into Vibelandia · one of our Vibelandia campuses · and within those nests. Within those nests: **by invitation only** — handled offline. Old school.

Creator / Studio pushing out requires the platform — executive commands, form, disengaged to produce. Rolling out immediately.

## NEST BUTTONS · GROUPS · TEAMS

**Nest buttons on buttons.** Any button can contain other buttons. Infinite nesting. Franchise within franchise. Empire within empire. As deep as you wish.

**Define groups and teams.** New richer collaborative vibe-based platform and experience. Groups = collections. Teams = collaborative units. All tied into Vibelandia.

## WHITEBOARD

Part of the experience. User sees something on the bulletin board → clicks to select → **push to their whiteboard**. Your whiteboard = where you keep your own version of things you've collected. Move them around. Do things with it. Delete. Ready to roll out as UI to everybody.
