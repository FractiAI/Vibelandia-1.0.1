## How to expand

1. Open [EPISODES_RICH_60_MINUTE_FULLY_SCRIPTED_DIRECTIVE.md](EPISODES_RICH_60_MINUTE_FULLY_SCRIPTED_DIRECTIVE.md) for structure and word targets per act.
2. For each episode: add full scenes, dialogue, and action beats in Cold Open, Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, and Tag until the file is **12,000 words**.
3. Use [episodes/EPISODE_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_NIGHT_AT_THE_CLUB.md](episodes/EPISODE_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_NIGHT_AT_THE_CLUB.md) or [episodes/EPISODE_CHRIS_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_RYE_PATCH_GOLD_MINE.md](episodes/EPISODE_CHRIS_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_RYE_PATCH_GOLD_MINE.md) as the **12k template** (full dialogue, CUT TOs, guest/host/V.O. pattern).
4. Run word count (e.g. PowerShell: `(Get-Content episodes\<file>.md -Raw | Measure-Object -Word).Words`) or editor word count. Update this table when an episode hits 12k.
