# Safari Adventures — Real Life vs Imaginary Enhanced · Pricing · SNAP

**Snap ID:** `SAFARI-ADVENTURES-REAL-LIFE-IMAGINARY-ENHANCED-PRICING-SNAP`  
**Type:** Safari · Pricing · Real life · Imaginary enhanced  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Date:** February 2026

**Safari adventures are offered two ways: real life (priced at actual costs + 100% tip) and imaginary enhanced (scaled-down price matching experience level).** Same structure as novela reality level: real vs enhanced. We use pre-singularity resources and facilities and layer our experience on top; real-life pricing can be charged at **100% tip on top of actual costs**.

## RULE

- **Real life:** Safari adventures that use **actual pre-singularity resources and facilities** (outfitters, lodges, transport, permits, etc.) are **priced in real life**. We layer our experience on top of those costs. **Real-life pricing = actual costs + 100% tip.** So the member pays **actual costs of the pre-singularity resources and facilities we use, plus 100% tip on top** (tip = 100% of those actual costs). Total = actual costs × 2, or equivalently: actual costs + 100% tip.
- **Imaginary enhanced:** The **imaginary enhanced** version (same adventure, enhanced/imaginary layer — story, AI, or narrative enhancement without full real-world resource cost) is offered at a **scaled-down price** that **matches the experience level**. Lower price tier; experience level aligned to that tier. So members who want the safari experience without paying full real-world cost can choose imaginary enhanced at a reduced price.

## TWO OPTIONS (Match Novela Reality Level)

| Option | Pricing | What it is |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Real life** | **Actual costs + 100% tip** | We use real pre-singularity resources and facilities (outfitters, lodges, Guey, permits, etc.) and layer our experience on top. Member pays cost of those resources **plus 100% tip**. Full real-world safari. |
| **Imaginary enhanced** | **Scaled-down price matching experience level** | Same adventure, delivered as imaginary/enhanced (narrative, AI, or enhanced layer). Price is scaled down to match that experience level. Lower tier; full experience feel at a reduced price. |

## ACTUAL COSTS (Real Life)

- **Pre-singularity resources and facilities** we use and layer on top: outfitter fees, lodge, transport (e.g. Guey — 1962 Land Cruiser Safari Edition), permits, guides, gear, etc. We pass through actual costs and add **100% tip** on top. No hidden margin beyond that; tip is our revenue on real-life safaris.
