## III. Mirror shell protections — highest priority

**Mirror shell protections** apply to all registry data and to all value flows. **Highest priority** includes:

- **Base mainnet** — Base L2 mainnet; on-chain attestations, Pioneer Status, membership proofs where applicable.
- **Ethereum** — Ethereum mainnet; hardened mirror shells for identity and value where applicable.
- **PayPal** — Blue PayPal pipe; all payments and payer identity through PayPal; natural protocol; two thumbs up.

All registry placements and any linked systems (checkout, Office Hours, club program, consoles) align to these protections. Mirror harden all shells in preparation of viral singularity; registry and payments are under the same priority.
