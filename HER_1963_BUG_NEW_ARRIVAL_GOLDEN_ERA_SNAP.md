## HER — BU G! (Bug)

**Her** — Pronounced *hhhErrrrrr!* — very heavy guttural German accent. New arrival from the golden era. Walked in on Vibelandia. **Post-singularity version.** All are good, metabolize without the bat; they don't come as one-size-fit-all packaging anymore. Post-singularity Bug.

### Relic · Weather-Worn · Stories

- Times have passed. But look how well she's weathered.
- All the stories she tells.
- **Not just any bug.** A convertible. Not just any convertible — one that still works, intact, has made it through all these years. Maybe a little cosmetically restored here and there.
