## BEATS

- **Automatically present** — No extra step. No "select language" required for skins to show in the right language. Presentation is automatic.
- **In the user's language** — The language the user expects (browser, locale, or selection). Skins render in that language.
- **Confirmed** — This is canon. We confirm: skins automatically present in the user's language.
- **Natural protocol** — Aligns with NSPFRNP; natural for the user; no friction.
