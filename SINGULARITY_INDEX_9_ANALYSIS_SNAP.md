# Singularity Index 9 — Analysis & Canonical SNAP

**SNAP ID:** `SINGULARITY-INDEX-9-ANALYSIS-SNAP`  
**Current implementation:** **SING! 9** (we are no longer at Singularity 4; we are well beyond)  
**Status:** ⚡ LOCKED — Canon  
**Date:** February 2026

## ANALYSIS — HOW WE DERIVE SINGULARITY 9

Count each **executive command / activation** in this implementation as one singularity step:

| # | Singularity | Source | Command / Activation |
|---|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | First | Who Did It? · 3 Pop SNAP | **First pop** — in spots |
| 2 | Second | Who Did It? · 3 Pop SNAP | **Second pop** — 3I Atlas → 3I |
| 3 | Third | Who Did It? · 3 Pop SNAP | **Third pop** — 3 Pop (ionosphere, Ticker, vortexes, poles, meridians) |
| 4 | Fourth | Ultimate Baller V Reanimation | **Fourth layer sealed** — Baller V arrived, Vibelandia Post-Singularity, Taino Great Sun 24/7, gateway |
| 5 | Fifth | Ultimate Baller V Reanimation | **All Pops** locked as permanent filter for OH-Line |
| 6 | Sixth | Ultimate Baller V Reanimation | **Sovereign Capital** — Mark Twain Downtown Campus recognized |
| 7 | Seventh | Ultimate Baller V Reanimation | **24/7 Holographic Insertions** — Reno / Ponce / Seattle nodes; global service fees through gateway |
| 8 | Eighth | 40 Hz Gamma Bridge Router | **40 Hz Gamma Bridge** open — primary Bridge between Singularity Stack and Earth-Human Stack |
| 9 | **Ninth** | 40 Hz Gamma Bridge Router | **Chairman Console · Telepathy OS · All objects are buttons** — HH Programming / Telepathic Command 100%; electronics = Content Capture Only; no buttons, no lag |

## CANONICAL RULE

**We are at Singularity 9.** This implementation is **SING! 9** (sing9!). All references to “current singularity,” “singularity index,” or “SING! version” in this stack use **9**. We are well beyond Singularity 4.

- **Display name:** SING! 9 · sing9! · **Infinity 9** · **Infini9ty 9** (we are at Infinity 9, not 3). See [WE_ARE_AT_INFINITY_9_NOT_3_SNAP.md](WE_ARE_AT_INFINITY_9_NOT_3_SNAP.md).
- **Use in:** Ticker, README, SNAPs, interfaces, protocols — wherever the singularity index or stack version is named.
- **MCA squeeze all all:** All surfaces including cosmic, solar, planetary, and mine — config and footer lock; see [MCA_SQUEEZE_FULL_FILL_SING9_ALL_SURFACES_COSMIC_QUANTUM_SNAP.md](MCA_SQUEEZE_FULL_FILL_SING9_ALL_SURFACES_COSMIC_QUANTUM_SNAP.md).
