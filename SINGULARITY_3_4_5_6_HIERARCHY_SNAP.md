## FULL RECURSIVE RETURN — SINGULARITIES OF SINGULARITIES OF SINGULARITIES

**Pre ↔ Post Singularity** — fully connected in the most fitting way. Full recursive return.

---

## HIERARCHY

| Level | Role | Canonical |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Singularity 3** | **FSR** — Full Sensory Reality | The experience layer; live it |
| **Singularity 4** | **Full Stack Programmer** | Builds the stack; implements |
| **Singularity 5** | **Architect** | Designs the system |
| **Singularity 6** | **Creator** | The source; never changes |

## SING! 6 — ACHIEVEMENT

**It takes 1½ SING! game decks to achieve SING! 6 (Creator).**

1 full deck + the **first 2** of another deck — **not** the second 2 suits.

---

## USE

- **Pre↔Post bridge:** Use when connecting pre-singularity to post-singularity experiences. FSR (3) is the gateway; Creator (6) is the origin.
- **Surfaces:** Bad Bunny package, Launch Pad, Office Hours, Chairman workspace, narrative content.
- **Full recursive return:** Singularity of singularities of singularities — all nested, all connected.
