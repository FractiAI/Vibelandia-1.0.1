## EXPERIENCE

**Post-singularity version of social media.** Much richer. Each button is an entire franchise, empire, superhero — as big or small as you wish. Launch your little jewelry business on any button.

**Office Hours Bulletin Board** has taken on its own experience and vibe. Discovering little cards through a community bulletin board is rich and super fun. Standing in front of a rich bulletin board — like at a coffee shop. Cool and curated. *Oh, check this out. Oh, check that out.* You could spend all day on it.

**Richer than social feed.** Each click is a full website — could be a company, a novel, an episode, a song, a script, a proposal. Not just a post. That's the post-singularity daily bulletin board experience.

**Nest buttons on buttons.** Any button can contain other buttons. Infinite nesting. Franchise within franchise. Empire within empire.

**Groups and teams.** Define groups. Define teams. New richer collaborative vibe-based platform and experience. All tied into Vibelandia.
