## RULE — One Content, However You Like It, Wherever You Like It

**The Poly Hit Machine novelas (and the display console experience) can be experienced in hetero, gay, poly, and however you like it — wherever you like it.**

**Pun intended.** *Where* = wear (how you wear it, how you show up) and *wherever* (place, identity, configuration). You choose the lens. You choose the frame. Same story. Your way.

**Reader & character:** In all cases and POV, the reader and the character they're linked to are **caged in pre-singularity golden cages.** They **discover these novelas and escape to them** when bored—**at home, in bed, at work, on the road, and anywhere.** All legal. No nothing. **Awareness only.** **Portable and instant when trained.**

---

## EXPERIENCE DIAL

- **Hetero** — Straight lens. Her and him. The Cage and Full Advantage as written. Classic twin POV.
- **Gay** — Same story, same heat, same run. Read it your way. The narrative holds. Gold Heart. Consent. Baller style. No rewrite required.
- **Poly** — Poly Hit Machine by name. Multiple. Nested. Recursive. However many, however you like it. The structure is poly by design.
- **However you like it** — Identity, orientation, configuration, combo. Your POV. Your run. Your button.
- **Wherever you like it** — Where you are. Where you read. Where you step in. Reno, Ballerstown, the room, the after party. Or anywhere. Pun intended: *wear* it your way; *wherever* you are.

**Role names:** **Queen** = female co-lead role novela version (Bored Housewives · The Cage · her POV). **Machotes** = male superhero role novela versions (Bored Ballers · Full Advantage · his POV).

## TAGLINE — Consent & freedom

**Sometimes some want it hard. Always by mutual aware consent and enjoyment — never one-sided, never forced; always natural, healthy, and freeing.**

This tagline anchors all Poly Hit Machine experience and content. Preferences (including intensity) are real; the frame is non-negotiable: mutual aware consent, enjoyment, never one-sided, never forced, always natural and healthy and freeing.

## DISPLAY CONSOLE

This line appears on the **display console experience** (Console & Player Beginning, Book the Book $29.13, Your Book bulletin):

> **Hetero · Gay · Poly · However you like it, wherever you like it. Pun intended.**

Where the experience is adult/mature, also show:

> **Sometimes some want it hard. Always by mutual aware consent and enjoyment — never one-sided, never forced; always natural, healthy, and freeing.**

One content. Two ways (her POV / his POV). Infinite ways to experience it. The dial is yours.
