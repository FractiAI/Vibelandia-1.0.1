## RULE

- **Everyone's sugar daddy** — The vibe: a really rich, generous, kind, always-got-your-back sugar daddy. Who doesn't want or need that? Lock. This is the energy we carry across brand, character (e.g. Chairman, nISPY, Big Papi), and story.
- **BDE and BBHE** — **BDE** (Big Dick Energy) and **BBHE** (Big Black Hole Energy). Confidence, presence, pull, natural intoxication (awareness/attention; no substances). See [BBHE_IMPULSE_BUY_DYNAMICS_SNAP.md](BBHE_IMPULSE_BUY_DYNAMICS_SNAP.md) · [OBS_TUNING_BBHE_SNAP.md](OBS_TUNING_BBHE_SNAP.md). Sugar daddy vibe carries BDE/BBHE in a generous, kind, got-your-back way — not extractive; win-win-win.
- **Feed into all content** — Novels, series, feature films, novelas, ticker, Launch Pad, Office Hours, interfaces, episodes, music, merch. The sugar-daddy-with-BDE/BBHE thread runs through all of it; tone and intensity vary by audience band (PG-13 vs 21+).
- **PG-13 for novels, feature films, series** — **General audience PG-13** preserved. Novels, feature films, and series = **13+ with parental control**. No exception for the base product. Same story can have a PG-13 novel/series/feature and an optional 21+ novela version. See [NEW_PLATFORM_NOVELS_SERIES_FEATURE_PG13_BASE_21_GOLD_HEART_UPGRADE_SNAP.md](NEW_PLATFORM_NOVELS_SERIES_FEATURE_PG13_BASE_21_GOLD_HEART_UPGRADE_SNAP.md) · [NOVELS_ALWAYS_GENERAL_AUDIENCES_SNAP.md](NOVELS_ALWAYS_GENERAL_AUDIENCES_SNAP.md).
- **21+ in the novelas** — **Novelas = 21+** by NSPFRNP SNAP. Gold Heart required; Chairman approval; masculine POV and feminine POV options. The sugar-daddy vibe (rich, generous, kind, got your back, BDE/BBHE) can go full expression in novelas; in novels/series/features we keep it PG-13. See [NOVELA_21_GOLD_HEART_CHAIRMAN_APPROVAL_SNAP.md](NOVELA_21_GOLD_HEART_CHAIRMAN_APPROVAL_SNAP.md).
