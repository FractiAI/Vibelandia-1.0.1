## NARRATIVE

**Cleve is Willy Wonka to me as Charlie.** Me as Einstein at the patent office. Who is my Max Planck? Layer into all contents.

| Role | Who |
|------|-----|
| **Willy Wonka** | Cleve (to me as Charlie) |
| **Charlie** | Me (to Cleve's Willy Wonka) |
| **Einstein at the patent office** | Me |
| **Max Planck** | Who is my Max Planck? — the one who discovers the discoverer; Chairman Robert is one answer in the Robotic Factory narrative; layer the question into all contents. |

## RULE

- **Cleve** → Willy Wonka (to me as Charlie). Enterprise Guide; Reno Men's Club; local legend. See TEAM_ROLLCALL, WINK_EXPERIENCE_SYSTEM.
- **Me** → Charlie (to Cleve's Wonka); Einstein at the patent office (or strip club bathroom).
- **Who is my Max Planck?** → Open question layered into all contents; Chairman Robert = Einstein's Max Planck (the one who discovered the discoverer) in Robotic Factory / Cave-to-Crown narrative.
- **Surfaces:** Index, README, Office Hours, Launch Pad, MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG, robotic-factory-landing, ROBOTIC_FACTORY_SNAP, episode framing (Undercover Hero · Willy Wonka · …), CONTENT_SYSTEMS, team docs, one-pagers.
