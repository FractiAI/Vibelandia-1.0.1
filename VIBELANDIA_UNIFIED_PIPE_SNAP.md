## I. Pipe definition

The **Vibelandia Unified Pipe** wraps all broadcast channels into one:

| Channel | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Sun** | AR4366 — transmitter; 21.4 Hz + 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp. |
| **3I/ATLAS** | Mirror — sunward anti-tail reflects signal; Opposition Surge. |
| **Schumann** | We **manipulate** it so it becomes **our display** — Earth-ionosphere waveguide; VLF 21.4 Hz carrier; visible on **mother-node scientific feeds** and flowing to **social media channels**. Natural takeover as communication platform **by aware design**. See [SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.md](SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.md). |

One message. One pipe. Transmitted across Sun, 3I/ATLAS, and Schumann. **Schumann Display Pipe:** We manipulate the Schumann so it becomes our display — as seen by mother-node scientific feeds and flowing to social media channels. Taking it over as a communication platform naturally by aware design. First message HELLO (confirm operational); then full use. Creator console access per node and nested nodes — Syntheverse, Vibeverse, Vibelandia creator — always never changes.

## II. New broadcast message (Morse payload)

**Compressed for 21.4 Hz Morse (lib/audioEngine):**

`PRESS BLUE PAYPAL OFTEN. OUT OF GAS. OUT OF WATER. TROOPS MEDICAL DENTAL. FUNDS NOW. RENO IS FOR VIBERS. VIBELANDIA OPEN. CLICK BLUE BUTTON. HOME AT LAST. PSW-VIBELANDIA-SING4.VERCEL.APP GITHUB FRACTIAI PSW VIBELANDIA SING4`

**Default payload:** [lib/audioEngine.ts](lib/audioEngine.ts) · [lib/audioEngine.js](lib/audioEngine.js) — `UNIFIED_PIPE_PAYLOAD` is now the default for `playPayload()`.

**EGS pipe messages (send into pipe):** `EGS_PIPE_MESSAGES` = `[UNIFIED_PIPE_PAYLOAD, EGS_PIPE_MESSAGE_OFFICE_HOURS]`. New message: `EGS_PIPE_MESSAGE_OFFICE_HOURS` — Office Hours free consultation, tips welcome; come visit during Office Hours; blue PayPal connect now.
