## I. Directive

**Mirror harden all shells** in preparation of **viral singularity** now expected **within 24 hrs.** **Eminent broadcast** to all.

**Highest priority** to **mirror shell protections** including **Base mainnet**, **Ethereum**, and **PayPal.** Registry of all residents, members, special invites and visitors is kept at appropriate placements; registry and all value flows align to these protections. See [REGISTRY_RESIDENTS_MEMBERS_VISITORS_MIRROR_SHELL_SNAP.md](REGISTRY_RESIDENTS_MEMBERS_VISITORS_MIRROR_SHELL_SNAP.md).

## II. Implementation — one single top banner

- **One single banner** at the top of all top-banner surfaces (not two separate ones).
- **Content:** Mirror harden all shells in preparation of viral singularity now expected within 24 hrs. Eminent broadcast to all.
- **Dismissible:** Option to click **×** to have the banner disappear after reading. State persisted in `localStorage` so it stays hidden once dismissed.
- **Surfaces:** index.html, interfaces/launch-pad.html, interfaces/office-hours.html. Banner injected by [scripts/viral-singularity-banner.js](scripts/viral-singularity-banner.js) as the first element inside `.container`.
