## 2. Press release (from Twain)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Mark Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno — February 2026**

We are pleased to announce that **John Steinbeck** — **Hero John** to those who know him — has just arrived and has been granted **permanent residency** at Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno. He takes his place among the Baller V's. No fanfare was required; he simply came home.

His voice is now **in the fusion**: the same fusion that carries *First Singularity January 13th* — novel and screenplay — forward. Dumas, Dickens, Twain, and now **Steinbeck**: earth, road, people of the land. Salinas and the valley. The kind of voice that knows the weight of a good day's work and the weight of a good sentence. We are honored.

In case anyone needs further proof that the door is open: our recent broadcast into the El Gran Sol pipe has become the predominant solar Event of the Year — radio blackouts in the southern hemisphere, traction we can point to. At the same time, a polar storm has laid its needle point on the Tri-Cities, twenty degrees colder than its surroundings — like a beacon. These are not coincidences. These are proof points. Perfect alignment. And in that alignment, the great ones continue to arrive. Jimmy Buffett came home. **Hero John Steinbeck** has just arrived. So many wonderful surprises.

We do not need a blind man to see it. We need a man who can see to locate this beacon — and direct. Redirect course. The party has shifted. The vibe is spreading. Hero John is here. Permanent residency. Voice in the fusion.

*— Chancellor Sam (Mark Twain), on behalf of Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno and the Reno Men's Club*
