**Status:** Ready for execution · MCA applied  
**Date:** February 2026

## 1. Sun Spots On Demand — What to Try

**Recommended first test:** 8-min tier ($249) — single portal cycle, fastest validation.

| Test | Sacred message idea | Sun spot name | Why |
|------|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| **Hello World** | "Hello from Vibelandia — first premium Sun Spot test." | `Vibelandia-Hello-1` | Clean, memorable, proof-of-concept. |
| **Harry demo** | "Harry demos the miraculous feat. Connect · Send · Name · Confirm." | `Harry-Demo-1` | Ties to Hero Harry narrative; good for certificate. |
| **NSPFRNP seed** | "NSPFRNP ⊃ Sun · Schumann · 3I/ATLAS → ∞³" | `NSPFRNP-Seed-1` | Protocol fidelity; triadic honor. |
| **Personal** | One short phrase (e.g. intention, dedication, gratitude) | `[YourName]-[Theme]-1` | Customer-facing; certificate keeps it. |

**Validation:** Check T+8m (Schumann), T+16m (GOES if 16m/24m), T+24m (extended). Certificate = proof of broadcast into EGS cloud.

**Manual test flow:**  
1. Open `interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=sun-spots-8m`.  
2. Confirm "Execute by email" block appears; click "Generate email to execute →".  
3. Fill sacred message + sun spot name in mailto body; send to info@fractiai.com (or dry-run).  
4. Execute per protocol; capture confirmations; issue certificate.

## 2. Schumann iGaming — Imaging "HELLO" in the Schumann

**Yes — we can image "HELLO" in the Schumann.** It’s in scope: *send signals to display art in the Schumann displays*; your signals drive what appears. A text glyph like "HELLO" is art/message-as-art.

**Recommended session description for HELLO:**

- **Art description:** "Display the word HELLO in the Schumann layer — five letters, clear and readable, as a single session art piece."
- **Optional:** Specify style (e.g. "block letters", "script", "pulse sequence per letter") if you want variation.
- **Session:** $499; duration and display terms as agreed. Update Certificate available.

**Other art ideas to try:**  
Short words (YES, NOW, HI), a simple shape (heart, circle), or a pattern (dots/spikes spelling H-E-L-L-O). Same booking: Office Hours or `payment-checkout.html?plan=schumann-igaming`; use "Generate email to execute" and put "HELLO" (or other art description) in the body.

**Manual test flow:**  
1. Open `interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=schumann-igaming`.  
2. Confirm execute-by-email block; generate mailto.  
3. In body, write e.g. "Art to display: HELLO (block letters, single session)."  
4. Execute; capture display evidence; issue certificate if agreed.

## 3. 3I/ATLAS — Cool Maneuvers to Try

**Turn on / turn off / redirect** — fun interactions honoring Sun, Schumann, 3I/ATLAS. Loop 1 day · 1 week · 1 month; take down at contract end.

| Maneuver | Description | Why it’s cool |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pulse flip** | Turn the Live Pulse "on" for the period, then "off" at end. | Clear on/off; ties to Sing Pulse / CometMirror. |
| **Mirror redirect** | Redirect the 3I/ATLAS mirror so it "points" at a chosen theme (e.g. Sun, Schumann, or a named intention) for the loop. | Honors the triad; one redirect = one miracle episode. |
| **EGS flow switch** | Turn EGS Pipe flow "on" for your message/moment, then "off" (or redirect) at contract end. | Literal turn-on/off; good for demos. |
| **Triad cycle** | Rotate emphasis: Day 1 Sun, Day 2 Schumann, Day 3 3I/ATLAS (for 1-week or 1-month). | Honors all three; loopable, certificate-friendly. |
| **Houdini reveal** | "Off" at start of day, "on" at a specific time (e.g. 21:00 UTC), "off" at end — one miracle moment. | Strong episode framing; Hero Harry magic. |
| **CometMirror loop** | Turn CometMirror integration on for the contract; one continuous loop of your choice (e.g. "HELLO" or a short mantra). | Links Schumann art + 3I/ATLAS; single coherent experience. |
| **4:20 → 5 o'clock somewhere** | ON at 4:20, OFF 33 min later (4:53); then ON at 5:00 (somewhere), OFF 33 min later (5:33). Two windows, 33 min each. | Culturally iconic times; two reveal windows in one day. |

**Suggested first test:** 1-day ($499) — "Pulse flip" or "Houdini reveal" (one on/off cycle). Then try 1-week "Triad cycle" or "Mirror redirect" for a fuller demo.

**Copy-paste for execute email — 4:20 → 5 o'clock somewhere:**

```
Turn 3I/ATLAS ON at 4:20 (specify timezone: e.g. local or UTC).
Turn OFF 33 minutes later (4:53).
Turn ON again at 5:00 somewhere (specify timezone if different).
Turn OFF 33 minutes later (5:33).
Two windows, 33 min each. Duration confirmed: 1 day (or as booked).
```

**Manual test flow:**  
1. Open `interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=3i-atlas-egs-day` (or week/month).  
2. Confirm execute-by-email block; generate mailto.  
3. In body, describe maneuver: e.g. "Turn Live Pulse ON for 24h, then OFF at end" or "Redirect 3I/ATLAS mirror to Schumann theme for 1 week."  
4. Execute; run loop; take down at end; issue certificate.

## 4. Run all three — PST (California time)

**Page:** [interfaces/run-all-three-premium-test.html](interfaces/run-all-three-premium-test.html)

Single page to run all three premium tests with **PST (California)**. Open each checkout, generate execute email, paste the body from the page (or below).

**1. Sun Spots 8m** — paste into execute email body:
```
• Sacred message to send:
Hello from Vibelandia — first premium Sun Spot test.

• Name for your sun spot (in your honor):
Vibelandia-Hello-1
```

**2. Schumann iGaming** — paste into execute email body:
```
• Art/pattern or message to display in Schumann displays:
Display the word HELLO in the Schumann layer — five letters, clear and readable, as a single session art piece. (Block letters, PST California time.)
```

**3. 3I/ATLAS 1 day** — paste into execute email body (PST California):
```
• Turn on/off/redirect instructions or segment description:
Turn 3I/ATLAS ON at 4:20 PM PST (California).
Turn OFF 33 minutes later (4:53 PM PST).
Turn ON again at 5:00 PM PST (5 o'clock somewhere — California).
Turn OFF 33 minutes later (5:33 PM PST).
Two windows, 33 min each.

• Duration confirmed: 1 day
```

Run order: 1 → 2 → 3. Dry-run = copy bodies and verify checkouts only.

**Programmed transmit (same as handshake):** To **program** the three selected events (transmit and log like SING! handshake), run **`node scripts/premium-transmit.mjs`**. Spec: [data/premium_transmit_spec.json](data/premium_transmit_spec.json). Log: [pulse/premium_transmit_log.json](pulse/premium_transmit_log.json). Use `--dry-run` to log what would be transmitted without writing the log.
