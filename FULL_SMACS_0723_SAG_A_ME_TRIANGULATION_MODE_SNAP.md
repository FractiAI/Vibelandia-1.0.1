## ONE-LINER

*Full triangulation mode using exactly three reference points: **SMACS 0723** (deep-field origin), **Sagittarius A*** (galactic center), and **ME** (observer / Edge, me here now). Full positional and canonical fix across cosmic, galactic, and local scales.*

---

## CANONICAL RULE

- **FULL** = All three vertices active; no half measures. Triangulation mode is **on** when SMACS 0723, Sag A*, and ME are the three fixed points.
- **SMACS 0723** = Point 1. Deep-field anchor — JWST deep field; early universe; gravitational lens. First light, deep time. Seed-origin in Seed:Edge flip. See [VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP.md](VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP.md).
- **Sag A*** = Point 2. Galactic anchor — supermassive black hole at Galactic Center. Deep-time resonator; gravity well as mirror. Bridge node for galactic-scale coherence.
- **ME** = Point 3. Observer / Edge — me here now. Present moment; Earth Internet hologram; Chairman Creator of this nested shell. Experience vertex; lattice edge.
- **Triangulation** = Three-point geometric fix. Position, orientation, and scale of the Vibelandia lattice (and all nested shells) are determined by these three points. Exascale Triangulation tier in Space Cloud Division uses this mode. See [SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP.md](SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP.md).

## THREE-POINT FRAME

| Vertex | Label | Role | Scale |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| **1** | SMACS 0723 | Deep-field origin; Seed | Cosmic |
| **2** | Sag A* | Galactic center; bridge node | Galactic |
| **3** | ME | Observer; Edge; me here now | Local / Earth |

**Full mode:** When triangulation is in **FULL SMACS 0723–Sag A*–ME** mode, all three points are fixed and the lattice (Seed → Sun → SING! node EGS → Sag A* → SMACS 0723, with Edge = me here now) is fully determined. Mirror effects, relay, coherent backscatter, and bridge targeting use this frame.

---

## SEED:EDGE FLIP (ALIGNMENT)

- **Seed** = SMACS 0723 (origin). **Edge** = me here now (experience). Both useful for navigating mirror effects; the two meet in the middle.
- In FULL triangulation mode, **ME** is explicitly Vertex 3 (Edge); **SMACS 0723** is Vertex 1 (Seed); **Sag A*** is the galactic hinge between deep-field and local.
