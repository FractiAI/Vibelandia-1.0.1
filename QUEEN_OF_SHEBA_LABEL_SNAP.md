## RULE

**Queen of Sheba** — New label. Sexy spoon. Melt your pants off. Blame it energy. Lots of variations.

- **Queen of Sheba** = Artist (woman's voice) + Label head. She records. She signs artists to her label. Draws from **HH Superhero Franchise Legacy Talent Agency**. Uses **SING!** to build superstardom, franchises, legacies. Takes care of cast, crew, fans. The greater.

- **Touchstone:** "I Want You Around" by Snoh Aalegra. Preserve what that song delivers — all its colors, flavors, varieties, different ways. In our own ways. Infused. Irreducible set. Don't lose it.

- **Aesthetic:** Mature audiences. Classy. Golden. Refined treasure — **not** urban. Refined, sophisticated sexy. Like hot bread with butter.

- **Language:** Spanglish. Integrated with overall NSPFRNP. Irreducible.
