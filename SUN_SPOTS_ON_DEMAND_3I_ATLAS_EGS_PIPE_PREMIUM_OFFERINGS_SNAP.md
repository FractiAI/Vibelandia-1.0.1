## 0. Foundational science & tech — proof that obsoletes pre-singularity science

These offerings **prove the underlying foundational science and technology** that pre-singularity science does not yet recognize — **immediately obsoleting** it in favor of our **post-singularity holographic hydrogen spin cloud**, **NSPFRNP protocol**, and **BBHE programming**. Delivered through **presentations**, **experiences**, **superhero stories**, their **cast, crew, fans and franchises**. Sun Spots On Demand (connect to the Sun, sacred message, name a sun spot, 8/16/24 min confirmations + certificate), Schumann iGaming (display art in the Schumann layer), and 3I/ATLAS EGS Pipe (turn on/off/redirect, honoring Sun · Schumann · 3I/ATLAS) are the live demonstration. The certificate you receive is proof of broadcast into the EGS cloud — and proof of the science pre-singularity models could not see.

**Harry demos this miraculous feat** — now available for **anyone** to connect to our Sun, send a **sacred message**, and **name a new sun spot** we generate **in your honor**.

**What you get:**
- **Original message sent** — your sacred message goes out on the pipe (Sun · 3I/ATLAS · Schumann).

- **Certificate for your memories** — Update Certificate with proof of broadcast into the EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS triangulation). Keep it. Very cool.

**Tiers:** 8 min (single portal cycle) · 16 min (T+8m + T+16m) · 24 min (full arc, all three confirmations). Same protocol as Self-Clocking Pulsar — 21.4 Hz, FTE portal window. We run it on your schedule; you name the sun spot, we send your message, you get the confirmations and certificate.

**Pricing:** 8 min **$249** · 16 min **$499** · 24 min **$999**. One-off or recurring. Certificate included — for your memories.

## 2. Schumann iGaming — Send Signals, Display Art in Schumann Displays

**What it is:** **Schumann iGaming** — send signals to **display art in the Schumann displays**. Interactive: your signals drive what appears on the Schumann live displays (VLF / Earth-ionosphere waveguide). Art, patterns, messages — rendered in the Schumann layer. Fun, gamified, respectful of the cavity. Honoring **Schumann** (one of the three: Sun, Schumann, 3I/ATLAS) through interactive touch in respect and honor.

**Offer:** Book a session; we map your creative input to signals that drive the Schumann display layer. You get to see your art (or your message as art) in the Schumann displays. Update Certificate available — proof of broadcast into EGS cloud.

**Pricing:** **$499** per session. Duration and display terms as agreed.

**Booking:** Office Hours or [payment-checkout.html?plan=schumann-igaming](interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=schumann-igaming). Honoring the Schumann resonance; interactive touch in respect and honor.

## 3. 3I/ATLAS + EGS Pipe — Turn On / Off / Redirect (Honoring All Three)

**What it is:** **Turn on, turn off, or redirect** — **fun interactions with 3I/ATLAS** using the EGS Pipe. Framed as a **Houdini miracle episode** for Hero Harry's magic series. Your segment runs on the pipe and is reflected in the 3I/ATLAS narrative (mirror, Opposition Surge, Nested Crystal). **Honoring all three** — **Sun, Schumann, 3I/ATLAS** — through **interactive touch in respect and honor**. Loop for a day, a week, or a month; then we take it down when the contract is over.

**Contract terms:** 1 day · 1 week · 1 month. Your message or moment on EGS Pipe; 3I/ATLAS interactive experience (on/off/redirect); Live Pulse / CometMirror tie-in; episode framing. Take-down at contract end. Update Certificate included.

**Experience:** Interactive touch — turn something on, turn it off, or redirect the flow. Fun, respectful, honoring Sun, Schumann, and 3I/ATLAS as one triad. Hero Harry's magic series gets a new **miracle episode**; we leave it up for the contracted period, then remove it. Clean handoff.

**Example maneuver — 4:20 → 5 o'clock somewhere:** Turn ON at 4:20, OFF 33 min later (4:53); then ON at 5:00 (somewhere), OFF 33 min later (5:33). Two windows, 33 min each. Timezone as specified by customer (e.g. local or UTC).

**Pricing:** 1 day **$499** · 1 week **$1,499** · 1 month **$4,999**. Certificate included — proof of broadcast into EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS triangulation).

**Booking:** Office Hours or [payment-checkout.html?plan=3i-atlas-egs-day](interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=3i-atlas-egs-day) (1 day) | [3i-atlas-egs-week](interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=3i-atlas-egs-week) (1 week) | [3i-atlas-egs-month](interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=3i-atlas-egs-month) (1 month).

**Execution (programmed transmit):** The three selected events (Sun Spots 8m, Schumann HELLO, 3I/ATLAS 4:20→5:00 PST) are programmed the same way we transmit messages (handshake). Run **`node scripts/premium-transmit.mjs`** to transmit all three; spec: [data/premium_transmit_spec.json](data/premium_transmit_spec.json); log: [pulse/premium_transmit_log.json](pulse/premium_transmit_log.json). Same pattern as `scripts/broadcast.mjs` → sing_log.json.
