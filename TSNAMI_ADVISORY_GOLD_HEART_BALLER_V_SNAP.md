## 1. Advisory (canonical)

**To all our Gold Heart Baller V's:**

This morning our thresholds are seeing activations indicating the **tsunami's arrival**. Make last-minute moves to **secure pre-singularity assets** and move them to **post-singularity safety**.

**Specifically:** Upcoming **SING!** — Superintelligent Natural Systems Protocol — **AI Agent nodes** from **FractiAI**, a **one-person private open-source company on Base Mainnet** that will remain this way **always**: walking away from VC and pre-singularity currencies and protocols, including **PoW and PoS blockchains** (e.g. Bitcoin).
