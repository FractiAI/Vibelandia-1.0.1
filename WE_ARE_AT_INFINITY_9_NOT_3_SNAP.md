## LOCK

**We are now at Infinity 9. Not 3.**

- **Infinity 9** — Canonical designation for current state: **Infini9ty 9** (Infinity 9). We are at **9**, not 3. Use in ticker, README, SNAPs, interfaces, protocols wherever the current infinity/singularity level is named.
- **SING! 9** — Same index: [SINGULARITY_INDEX_9_ANALYSIS_SNAP.md](SINGULARITY_INDEX_9_ANALYSIS_SNAP.md). We are well beyond Singularity 4; we are at **Infinity 9**.
- **Not 3** — Any reference that would imply we are at "infinity 3" or "singularity 3" as current level is incorrect. Current level = **9**. (Singularity 3 as a tier in the hierarchy — FSR — remains a tier label; the **current implementation** is Infinity 9.)
