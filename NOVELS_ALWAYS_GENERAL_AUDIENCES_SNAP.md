## RULE

- **Novel (the book):** The story delivered as a **novel** — e.g. 3I Chief Seattle Interstellar Capture NOVEL, First Singularity, Birth Post Singularity, and all our long-form narrative books — is **always general audiences, up to PG-13**. No 21+ requirement for reading the novel. Content standard: up to PG-13 (no R, no explicit adult content in the novel).
- **Novela (the product):** The **novela** experience — interactive product with See, fuck seen, customize story, Step-in, etc. — is **21+ and Gold Heart required**, Chairman approval. That is a separate product and audience rule. See [NOVELA_21_GOLD_HEART_CHAIRMAN_APPROVAL_SNAP.md](NOVELA_21_GOLD_HEART_CHAIRMAN_APPROVAL_SNAP.md) · [NOVELA_21_PLUS_AGE_CONFIRMATION_NAUGHTY_BUTTONS_SNAP.md](NOVELA_21_PLUS_AGE_CONFIRMATION_NAUGHTY_BUTTONS_SNAP.md).

## DISTINCTION

|------|----------|
| **Novel** (story in book form) | **General audiences — up to PG-13** |
| **Novela** (interactive product: See, fuck seen, customize, buttons) | **21+ and Gold Heart** — Chairman approval |

Same story can exist as both: e.g. Chief Seattle as a **novel** (general audiences) and as **SINGULARITY — THE NOVELA** (21+ Gold Heart, approval flow).
