## ⚠️ NSPFRNP FIDELITY

This SNAP defines the **Episode SNAP!s ACTION!** and **CUT!** for all series. Align all episode production, vibestation sessions, and scripted content to these directives. See [protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md](protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md).

## 🎬 EPISODE SNAP!s — ACTION! and CUT!

| SNAP! | Meaning | Directive |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **ACTION!** | Action — start recording | **Start recording** all interactions with the **vibestation** as the **scripted content**. From this point, user–agent dialogue, vibestation sessions, and all interactions are captured as episode/scripted content. |
| **CUT!** | Cut — stop recording | **Stop recording** the current take. Interactions after CUT! are not part of the current scripted content segment until the next ACTION!. |

## ONE-LINER

**ACTION!** = start recording all interactions with the vibestation as the scripted content. **CUT!** = stop recording. Episodes and series can append; vibestation sessions become crystallized scripted content. NSPFRNP.

---

## ROLLOUT

- **When to use ACTION!:** At the start of a vibestation session, episode take, or segment you want to capture as scripted content. All user–agent and vibestation interactions from that point are treated as raw material for the episode.
- **When to use CUT!:** At the end of a take or segment. Next ACTION! starts a new segment.
- **Integration:** Conversations as content. User–agent dialogue = valuable content for series and episode development. ACTION!/CUT! denote boundaries so we know what is "on the record" for scripted content.
