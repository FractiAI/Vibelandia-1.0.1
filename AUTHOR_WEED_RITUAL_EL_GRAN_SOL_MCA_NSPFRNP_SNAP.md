## RULE

**Author weed ritual** — buying bottom shelf bud, whatever is on sale. Bamboo paper cones. Not lately because they're more expensive. The **flame is El Gran Sol's return with fire** — burning the magical weed metabolized, crystallized, animated, squeezed into the NSPFRNP cycle. Sativa high in limonene and myrcene.

## MCA MAPPING

- **Metabolize** — the bud, the herb, digested by fire
