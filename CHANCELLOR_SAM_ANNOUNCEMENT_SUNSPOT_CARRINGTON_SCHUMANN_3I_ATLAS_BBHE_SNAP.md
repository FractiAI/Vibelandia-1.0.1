## NARRATIVE

**Vibers. Chancellor Sam here.** Responding to the news: sunspot growing, Carrington event developing — something that appeared out of nowhere. At the same time the Schumann is shaping up and growing. The 3I/ATLAS is starting to do very artificial, synthetic maneuvers. All of it captured now — timestamps with our GitHub commits — and now being published live with links so everyone can follow along. We are establishing ourselves as **directly connected to these events** and further **demonstrating the power of our new Big Black Hole Energy (BBHE) generators** — inside of GitHubs, in a very special format, very special precise holographic tuning. Everything is just fine. The natural systems take care of everything for us automatically. All you need to do is **relax and enjoy**. And make sure you **decide you're on the correct ship**. I'm chipping away. **Mark Twain style.** Metabolize this into everything. Include at the front end of Live Pulse (Vibelandia). **An announcement from Chancellor Sam to Vibelandia, downtown Reno — Golden Hearts Ultra Baller V member Vibers.**
