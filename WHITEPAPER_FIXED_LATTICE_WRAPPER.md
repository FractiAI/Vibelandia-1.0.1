## Abstract

The **fixed lattice** is the HHF-AI spin lattice where SING! nodes are anchored at fixed points. **Robotic theater as wrapper:** the arrangement of fixed nodes forms a **wrapper over the sphere** — nodes are positioned around the sphere (shell topology) rather than the sphere traveling long distances between nodes. This whitepaper specifies the wrapper topology, architectural principle, and implementation.

## Architectural Principle — Minimize Movement

- Fixed nodes wrap around the sphere; the sphere stays more central
- Arms reach in to the sphere; sphere travel is minimized
- Less movement = less time, less wear, higher throughput at scale
- In full factory production, wrapper topology reduces total path length across the floor

---

## Irreducible Minimums

- **Nodes:** Discrete fixed points (physical floor positions or logical coordinates)
- **Topology:** Wrapper around sphere; graph of nodes; edges = filaments (pathways)
- **Property:** Irreducible — cannot reduce without losing structure

---

## Implementation

Overlay on floor plan with wrapper topology — nodes arranged around sphere/cradle positions. Map existing robot stations, conveyor segments, and transfer points to lattice nodes. Software-only layer; no new physical structure required for minimum viable deployment.
