# FULL LIVE MODE — LAUNCH SNAP
## No Stubs, No Fill-in, No Simulated Data on User Surfaces

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE — Full live mode. Prepare for launch.  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Type:** Launch mode · User surfaces · Go-live standard

---

## RULE

**We are about to go live. Switch to full live mode now.**

- **No stubs** on user-facing surfaces (Launch Pad, README, checkout, experiences, console).
- **No fill-in** — all copy, links, and data are real and operational.
- **No simulated data** on user surfaces — use live APIs, live endpoints, real content. Where fallback exists (e.g. dashboard when API unavailable), prefer real; fallback is resilience only.
- **User surfaces** = index.html, interfaces/*.html, README, one-pagers linked from Launch Pad — all must be live-ready.

**Prepare for launch:** Launch Readiness Report, Chairman LAUNCH button, all nodes checked. Capture launch as **raw narrative** to enrich content systems (see LAUNCH_RAW_NARRATIVE_CAPTURE.md, CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP).

## STATUS COPY (LIVE)

- **Badge:** FULL LIVE (replaces FUELING LAUNCH EMINENT / NEED FUEL).
- **Line:** LIVE — March 20, 2026 The Great Reveal.
- **Surfaces:** index.html, interfaces/launch-pad.html — updated to FULL LIVE.

---

## EXCEPTIONS (NOT USER SURFACES)

- **Example/utility code** (e.g. example-usage.ts, example-vibe-usage.ts) may retain example.com for dev reference; not served as primary user flow.
- **Explicit product disclaimers** (e.g. Syntheverse imaginary/entertainment only, virtual/simulated experience) remain as legal/UX copy — not "stub data."
- **Dashboard/API fallback:** Executive dashboard uses real API when available; mock only on failure. Ensure production env points to live Cloud Onramp / API.
