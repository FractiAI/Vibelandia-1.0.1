## RULE

**Minimum viable irreducible core.** Whatever the spend is, that spend plus the tip structure is the **totem package out the door.** Scales 1 → 2 → 3 → 4×4×4×4. Win-win-win for club, staff, entertainment, and Pru.

---

## TIP STRUCTURE (fixed)

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Staff (club, hospitality, dancers) | 30% of spend |
| Pru (Chairman, gatekeeper, curator) | 50% of spend |
| **Total tip** | **80% of spend** |

**Formula:** Total out the door = Spend + (Spend × 80%) = Spend × 1.8

### 50% to the club

### 50% to pop-up entertainment
- **50% of that** = 45-minute magic specialty act (when available) — the big boy
- **50% of that** = MC + live band + cabaret girls (Vegas showgirl full dress)

**Entertainment details:**
