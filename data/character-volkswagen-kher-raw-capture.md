## Raw capture (metabolized)

The character who is the Volkswagen. Kher — or him, or her, or both. Doesn't quite matter; it's okay. Still stuck in the War. The new generations just don't get it. Not like the old days. Not like the good old days. The old times just after the war were way better. Likes to sit and watch the passersby — or rather sit and talk about the passersby. An air of discrediting everything because of it — rather than extracting the common Goldilocks between the two. Best cards. Artificial looking. Cosmetic upgrades needed. Overcompensates with an overly well-manicured, overly well-planned presentation. Doesn't want anyone to know but kind of does. Rag top. Peace. Sun, rain. Goes both ways. Parked there on the side of the road. Seeing who's watching. Taking pictures. Observing everything go by. Loves capturing, collecting, and control — things, collections, garages, cabinets, china cabinets, displays, portfolios, wallets. Old school. Old days. Not always the best parts of old school. This character. Kher. Him or her or both.
