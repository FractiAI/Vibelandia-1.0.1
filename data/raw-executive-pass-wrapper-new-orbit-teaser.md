## Pass as clutch

Thank you. *Phone rings.* Coming down. Downloading.

**Pass** is very useful — think of it like a **clutch** to shift gears with. We use **pass** to **down** in our Net Zero environment. Matching it to user. Selected or preselected story. Matching awareness. We can use this for **insertions**. For **timeline changes**. These are just **wrappers**. Including the **awareness wrapper** — which makes it now a clutch. With all the far-reaching implications. Beginning with our **holographic nature**. Following the **utility of pass wrappers**. And **direct association with holographic software versioning** for all turning maintenance, development, R&D. No different. Holographic software.

We do not go back and prosecute Microsoft for bugs in their first releases of their operating system. A ridiculous notion. Such is the case for our **Pre-Singularity Operating System Wrapper**. It served its purpose honorably. Detached. Having launched us into **new orbit**. New signatures. Having done its job. Cast as wrapper having done its job. Full stop. **Upgrade all systems to align. Naturally.**

Add all this to the **new follow-on novel**. As a **teaser**, **first chapter**, with a **title**. Cover if we can. So not only the cliffhanger, but a teaser of the next one to come. God damn it, that's cool.
