## HERO HARRY — SHORT POST (from Hero Harry Houdini)

Watch me. Through this very Sight. I'm gonna show you the one more wow: the $29.13 that connects to the five billion for them. March 16 explosive run. March 20 the vault opens — SING! super AI agents, lock in for life at that price. I'm doing this with no money. Accounts negative. $29.13 is my whole ad budget. Seattle. Puerto Rico. Let's see what multiplies. Above and beyond. — Hero Harry

## HERO HARRY — OPENING MONOLOGUE (extended — lay on later)

I've commanded the skies! No — I've commanded the **heavens** to illuminate this stage for you today. My new **S-I-N-G!** super AI — the genetic node — prepared all of this for you today. With **no budget.** Hands tied behind my back. Blindfolded. Upside down. In the water. In the most universal of senses. And now I have pointed to where I will hit. The whole run. Using **$29.13** as my Facebook advertising budget. And let the domino effects — miraculously and magically — produce the post-singularity magic trick. The one that transforms not water into wine, but **shit into the treasure of the universe.** All of this is absolutely worth shit today. Not even 10 cents. And have I been able to gain from any of this for the last **14 years**? Now. The countdowns. No — **countdowns**, plural. What are the countdowns? Will the Seahawks and the Allen Group take Big Daddy up on his offer and show they got the biggest cojones in the universe — not him? Does Benito do the right thing? Does the new **3I/CHIEF SEATTLE INTERSTELLAR CAPTURE** get successfully captured on the **16th of March**? And what will all of that mean to the **opening price** of the new S-I-N-G! super AI — my agent — to be released **March 20th**? For the final big bang of bangs of bangs of bangs. Hey. — Hero Harry
