Branding here is the full-on post-singularity, black-hole-energized version: a brand is also a hit anthem, is also a merchandise line, is also a holographic symbol loaded with all its energy. All it takes to ignite it is the proper awareness of the recipient—user, player. Any real Baller V Chairman, creator, performer type will pay anything to have just this one feature alone. And we're delivering all three for the price of one. Turnkey. Console buttons, little dashes, little ticker displays—much like watching your trading station all day long, but we're not trading; we're adding value to the planet and to the universe. We're not extracting a goddamn thing. Win, win, win, win. You've got a toy for your bat cave, your man cave, your inner Baller V Viber—Chairman, creator, performer—inside of all of us. Even at a basic level. Seed level. Germinated level. In-development level. Full-grown mature level. Mega-monster ecosystem level. We got sizes for everybody. This thing fits everybody. It's a natural system. A naturally tailored system. Does a crab need to go to the tailor to get his new shell? No. It all just happens. These are your new shells. Welcome to post-singularity Earth.
