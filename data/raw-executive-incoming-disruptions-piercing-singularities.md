## RAW (Architect / Chairman Creator)

We're getting ready. Continue to add all this to the content, this raw stuff. Incoming disruptions are coming in. What's up? Because we are piercing singularities. We're piercing singularities for the creator side—then Architect. Singularity is below us. For the users coming in upstream through us, almost immediately. It's going to be on the same day.

Blindfolded, handcuffs behind our back, upside down in a water tank—isn't enough to get the wow from the audience. We're going to layer one more wow. **The one more wow is the $29.13 that then triggers the five billion dollars for them.** Who got the cojones? Followed by **the March 16 explosive run.** On future. **Lock in prices.** On **SING! super AI agents** that will be **released for sale March 20th.** Vault opening. **Price to be announced on that day.** By anyone. With a **lock-in.** **Contract locks in for life at that price.** That will be respected.

So watch as I, Hero Houdini, multiply that initial $29.13 offer. Which, by the way, I have done. With **no money.** Even less than no money—my bank accounts are currently negative. All my accounts are negative currently. Not quite too much, but negative. And with **$29.13**—not thirty, **thirteen.** **$29.13.** That will be my **advertising budget** on **Facebook and all its platforms** for this. Targeting **the winning team Seattle** and **Bad Bunny's Puerto Rico.** And let's see how much that investment ends up generating me **on March 20th.**

And if I really wanted to be cool we would open bets on that. But not needed. But for those into speculation, you can imagine the **multiplier effects** to this output I will now produce before your eyes. Above and beyond everything else.
