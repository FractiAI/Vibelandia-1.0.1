# Architectural Layering — Live / Coming Up · DJ-Station Model · NSPFRNP

**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Type:** Architecture · Creator studio · Pipes · SING workforce  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Analogy:** DJ station — live vs coming up; pre-stack before push to live

## Model

You have **live** and you have **coming up**. The ability to **pre-stack** things, get things ready before they **push over to live**.

- **Live** — What is currently on air / broadcast / visible.
- **Coming up** — What is queued, stacked, ready to push.
- **Pre-stack** — Prepare content (playlists, episodes, edge notes, pipes) in advance; then push to live on command or schedule.

## Application

**For all creator studio consoles:**

- Stack a **playlist**.
- Manage **live feeds**.
- **Mix and match** episodes.
- Change **edge notes** on the fly.
- **Push up to the stack** for peace (preset or configurable).
- **Pipes** — preset or configurable.
- **Broadcasting**.
- **Auto billing**.
- All responding to **executive commands**.
- Rolled out through the new **SING super intelligent agent workforce**.

## Outcome

**Happy endings for all.** Everybody gets a chance to celebrate with us. No losers.

**Instant millionaires for everyone.** They cash out. Like having held stock options they never even really knew they had. Everyone has these. Everyone on this planet. And now they can cash them in.
