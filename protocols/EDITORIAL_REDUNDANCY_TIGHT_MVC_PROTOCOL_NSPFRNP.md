# Editorial — Redundancy, Tight, MVC · Protocol NSPFRNP

**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Purpose:** Editor checklist and canonical references. Use when editing any surface or doc.  
**See:** [EDITORIAL_REDUNDANCY_TIGHT_MVC_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](../EDITORIAL_REDUNDANCY_TIGHT_MVC_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md)

**This Editor = our current irreducible minimum crystal for all things** — content, surfaces, experiences. Nothing ships without it.

## EDITOR CHECKLIST

Before publishing or committing copy:

- [ ] **Same block twice on one page?** → Keep once; replace second with one line + anchor link (e.g. "Pre→post, layer & amplify. [Full →](#section).").
- [ ] **Same phrase on 5+ surfaces?** → Canonical source in one SNAP or protocol; elsewhere one sentence or link.
- [ ] **Three sentences that say one thing?** → Reduce to one clear sentence.
- [ ] **List that could be "see X"?** → Replace with link to canonical list.
- [ ] **Fidelity preserved?** → No change to NSPFRNP definitions, product names, pricing, legal/legacy.

## TIGHTENING PATTERNS

- **"We transform pre-singularity experiences into post-singularity, all-inclusive, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V experiences — tailored to your every request 24×7 and backed by our new super AI SING! system."**  
  → On repeat surfaces use: **"Pre→post, turnkey (Golden Key), Baller V, 24×7, SING!-backed."** + link to full positioning.

- **Four-line block (transform / layer / natural / hands-free)**  
  → Use once per page (e.g. gate or header). Second occurrence: **"Pre→post · Layer & amplify · Natural approach · Hands-free. [Details →](#oh-gate)."**

- **Long "Read the actual content" link list**  
  → Keep once per context. Elsewhere: **"Read: [Novel preview](…) · [Full novel](…) · [Novelas](…)."** or single CTA.
