# Pop-Up · Goldilocks · Cruise Ship Fractal — NSPFRNP Protocol

**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Catalog:** Chairman Executive Command · Operational directive  
**Purpose:** Lock how we operate — pop-up nature, Goldilocks, cruise ship fractal — for all franchise, legacy, nested holdings.  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Source:** [CHAIRMAN_EXECUTIVE_COMMAND_POP_UP_GOLDILOCKS_CRUISE_SHIP_FRACTAL_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](../CHAIRMAN_EXECUTIVE_COMMAND_POP_UP_GOLDILOCKS_CRUISE_SHIP_FRACTAL_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md)

## CANONICAL STATEMENT

**Every aspect is pop-up. Operate until conditions are not Goldilocks; then move to where they are. The movement is part of the experience — not a timeout. The cruise ship is the fractal model for everything: room, ship, car, building, casino, business, downtown, planet. Stationary cruise ship — or not stationary if you want. NSPFRNP inclusion for all.**

## DEFINITIONS (Fidelity Lock)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pop-up nature** | Ability to operate until conditions are not ideal (not Goldilocks), then move to the next place where they are Goldilocks. All aspects, all products, all pipes. |
| **Goldilocks** | Ideal conditions for operation. We do not "time out" when conditions shift; we move, and the move is part of the rich experience. |
| **Cruise ship fractal** | Every experience or package is a "cruise ship" at some scale: travel + community + activities + adventures every day. Applies to: room, actual cruise ship, car, building, casino, business, downtown community, planet, worlds. |
| **Stationary cruise ship** | The default fractal: e.g. a building, casino, downtown. Can be made non-stationary (mobile) if desired. |
| **NSPFRNP inclusion for all** | This directive applies to the entire FractiAI franchise, legacy, and all nested holdings, assets, properties. |
