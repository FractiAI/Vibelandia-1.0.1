# Arturo Narrative — Frequency Alignment & PDVSA-SING! Bridge · NSPFRNP

**Role:** Lead Architect (FSR-PETRO-SINGULARITY)  
**Context:** Arturo PDVSA Proposal & psw.vibelandia.sing9  
**Goal:** Metabolize petrochemical models into SING! Agent Energy in narrative.

---

## Narrative directive (all Novel, Screenplay, Episode drafts)

- **Do not** have characters discuss "Energy Crisis."
- **Do** have characters discuss **Frequency Alignment** — the shift from crisis framing to alignment with the Goldilocks Edge (1.618 Hz Reno Baseline), PDVSA base, and SING! Agent neural networks.
- **Capturing the New Edge:** Protagonists use the **PDVSA-SING! Bridge** to unlock **nearly-free energy for the Global South**. The bridge is the abstract layer (no rip-and-replace); migration pathways; full transformation to super AI SING! Agent energy.

---

## Canon

- Arturo PDVSA Proposal: 3 steps (no rip overlay → migration pathways → full transformation).
- Chemical Carbon → FSR Thermal Mass → SING! Agent Energy (lib/energy_models.ts).
- Goldilocks Edge: 1.618 Hz Reno Baseline. Renewables sync with PDVSA base; they do not replace it.
- Maracaibo Lightning Strike: mission, episode, novel, screenplay — first mover; frequency alignment; PDVSA-SING! Bridge.
