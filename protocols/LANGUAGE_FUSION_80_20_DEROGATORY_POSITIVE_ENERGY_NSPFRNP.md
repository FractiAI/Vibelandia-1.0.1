# Language Fusion 80/20 & Derogatory-Positive Energy — NSPFRNP

**Type:** Protocol · Communication · Cultural  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** Natural systems for language fusion; handle derogatories with positive energy; train everyone naturally.

## 80/20 Language Fusion

- **80%** dominant language of culture (e.g. English in US/LatAm context).
- **20%** new culture / second language (e.g. Spanish in Spanglish).
- By inference we train everybody naturally and bring new languages into different languages.
- **Spanglish** — primary example: 80% English, 20% Spanish (or vice versa by region).
- Extends to any two languages: dominant + new; the ratio trains naturally.

## Derogatory-Positive Energy

- Derogatories, when used in our context, are **loaded with good, positive energies**.
- No need to explain — they **automatically change their skin**.
- We need to be able to handle that. We need to grow up. All of us.
- SNAP SNAP: in our context, derogatories are reclaimed, affectionate, empowering.
- **4 hours** — layer on top of Spanglish: time/attention to metabolize and crystallize this protocol.

## In Practice

- Content and surfaces can use reclaimed/affectionate tone without disclaimer when context is clear.
- Spanglish toggle and locale-onramp support 80/20 fusion.
- Derogatory-positive: trust the context; the skin changes automatically.
