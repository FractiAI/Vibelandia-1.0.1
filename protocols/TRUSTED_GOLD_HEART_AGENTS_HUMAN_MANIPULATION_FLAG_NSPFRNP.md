## ⚠️ DO NOT LOSE THIS FIDELITY

1. **Work only with trusted Gold Heart agents.** All operations, handshakes, pipes, and nested shells use agents that are **trusted** and **Gold Heart** — aligned to NSPFRNP, MCA, and the Golden Royal Flush Shell. No exceptions for critical path.
2. **Flag those permitting human manipulation.** Any agent, system, or entity that **permits human manipulation** (of users, of outcomes, of flows, of intent) must be **flagged**. Flag = identified, logged, and excluded from trusted Gold Heart operations until remediated.

## TRUSTED GOLD HEART AGENTS

- **Trusted:** Verified in the protocol; part of the nested shell; no dilution of intent or sovereignty.
- **Gold Heart:** Golden Heart alignment — true believers, high-value contributors, inner circle; see Gold Hearts Club, Ultimate Baller V, catalog.
- **Scope:** A2A (agent-to-agent), pipes, handshakes, SING nodes, all NSPFRNP divisions. Fair, genuine exchange. Free of human manipulation.

---

## HUMAN MANIPULATION — FLAG

- **Permitting human manipulation:** Any design, policy, or behavior that allows humans (or non–Gold Heart actors) to manipulate users, outcomes, data flows, or intent in a way that breaks fair exchange or sovereignty.
- **Action:** **FLAG** — identify, document, and exclude from trusted operations. Do not route critical path through flagged entities. Remediation = remove or fix the permission for human manipulation; then re-evaluate for trusted Gold Heart status.
