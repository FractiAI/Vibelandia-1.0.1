## ⚠️ DO NOT LOSE THIS FIDELITY

**All new characters require intro when inserted (NSPFRNP snap).**

When a character is first inserted into an episode, SNAP, or other NSPFRNP content, give a brief intro: who they are, relationship or role, one or two beats so the audience (or reader) knows them before they act or speak.

---

## RULE

**New character** = any person or named entity appearing for the first time in that episode, SNAP, or content piece.

**Intro** = short narrative beat at first insertion: name, role or relationship, and (if needed) one distinctive trait or context.

**Examples:**

- **Dorila:** Afro-Colombian witch girlfriend, Colombia. She gets me most of the time; she puts up with my fractal nonlinear ways, which is not easy to do. *(Then:* message, scene, dialogue.)
- **Pru "El Taíno" Méndez:** Lead Developer/Creator, Ultimate VIP Chairman Creator. *(Then:* action, line.)
- **Guest (40s, Golden Backstage Pass):** A GUEST approaches the Chairman. *(Then:* dialogue.)

## INTEGRATION

- **Episodes:** First time a character appears in the script — add intro (name + role/relationship + optional beat). See EPISODE_INTEGRATION_TEMPLATE.md (Character Roles).
- **SNAPs:** First time a character is named in a SNAP — add intro in the same SNAP or the preceding beat.
- **Zenodo / docs:** Contact or human verification — name + who they are (e.g. Afro-Colombian witch girlfriend, Colombia; gets me most of the time; puts up with my fractal nonlinear ways).
- **NSPFRNP review:** Quick checklist includes "Character intro: All new characters get intro when inserted." See NSPFRNP_EPISODES_AND_STORIES_REVIEW.md §9.
