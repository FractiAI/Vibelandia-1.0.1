# Valuation Window — Days Since 2026-01-13 (NSPFRNP)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Type:** Evaluation / valuation standard

---

## RULE

**Evaluations and valuations are not fixed at any number of days. The valuation window is always:**

**N = days since 2026-01-13**

**On each document update:** Recompute N (current date − 2026-01-13) and use N in all evaluation/valuation text, tables, and blocks. Replace the previous day count with the new N so evaluations always reflect the latest.

- Prospectus §9 and Appendix A: use **N days** / **N-day window**
- NSPFRNP Real Numbers SNAP, SIXTEEN_DAYS_VALUATION block, TWO_PAGER, catalogs, README: use **N days** and update N on each revision
- One-pager, Executive Summary, "What we value at" bottom block: use **N days**

**Canonical anchor:** 2026-01-13. No fixed "16 days" or other constant — always current N.
