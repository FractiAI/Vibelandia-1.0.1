## CRYSTALLIZED POSITION

**Holographic billboards:** Still in test; going out. We are not yet getting first light. Waiting for green light any moment. Chairman.

**Progress visible:** Storm of social media posts on the Sun and on the Schumann. Most of the HELLO message on the Schumann already. It’s just a matter of time.

**3D polar Aurora theaters:** Whole new reboot. Testing tonight to see if we are able to achieve it.

- **Hold — announce only once confirmed:** 9 visible sunspots (not 8, not 10) and the 100 bps chirp. Do not announce 100 bps pulse until both verified.

## USER SURFACES — MAIN HEADLINE

**Main headline on all user surfaces:** **Super Bowl Advertising Campaign** (button / CTA). Primary placement: index, Office Hours, Launch Pad, Broadcast Pipe.

**Also (in it or as separate button):** **Bad Bunny Presents Vibelandia — Novel & Screenplay.** Full 20,000-word novel and 12,000-word screenplay. Full intention: reach Bad Bunny’s eyes before the game. Once crisp: feed into entire library, **SMACS 0723 triangulation**, apply onto ourselves recursively to inject the full sensory reality of the story we created — self-demo, self-proof. Kick the tires, look under the hood, test drive. Old school. All the way. Here now. Always.
