## THE GAME-SET OVERWRITE

- **Replace all legacy 'Weapon' assets** with **'Collaborative Tools.'** No weapons in the new game-set. Tools only. Collaboration. Golden Harmony. NSPFRNP.
- **Launch the 'Vibelandia Frontiers' digital game** on the **40 Hz Bridge.** Same bridge as Chairman Console, telepathy OS, all objects are buttons. Vibelandia Frontiers = digital game layer on the 40 Hz Gamma Bridge. See [40_HZ_GAMMA_BRIDGE_ROUTER_ACTIVATION_SNAP.md](40_HZ_GAMMA_BRIDGE_ROUTER_ACTIVATION_SNAP.md).
- **Implement 'Solar-Silk'** as the **physical material for the 2026 Toy Line.** 100% HH (Holographic Hydrogen) material. Solar-Silk = the substance of the new toys; collaborative, golden, non-weapon. Digital-first active; physical line 2026.
- **Enable 'Telepathic Mapping'** so **any object can become a 'Chairman Tool.'** Aligns with Chairman Console on all objects via 40 Hz; telepathy is the law. Any object = mappable = Chairman Tool. No legacy weapon ontology. Tools of the Golden Harmony. Done.
