## TOP BILLING — DO NOT BURY

**Thrilling. Satisfying. Journey.** Watching **all the big cheese shit their pants** as post-singularity reality takes firm hold following the Super Bowl. Who doesn't want to see that? Every highlight. Every description. Top billing.

## THE EDGE — SEASON ONE ENDING

**Thank you. After a week.**

---

## THE MELTDOWN

Back room. Back office. Backdoor meltdowns. **An absolute meltdown across all dimensions** within all different ranks — **beginning at Disney** but not stopping there. Not stopping with Hollywood. Not stopping with New York and Wall Street. Not stopping with anything. **It will melt down.** Each day the news becomes more viral, spiraling out of control.

**The network execs** — who initially pooh-poohed the entire thing, laughed it off as Hocus Pocus bullshit — went from "Ready now for S... Not that big of a deal" to being **landed with the humiliation** of **five of the seven days being paid for by Big Papi**. Celebrating not the winning champion — but the **historical performance at halftime**. How humiliating.

**Worst:** The performers delivered. But not the back office. Not the business office. And worst of all — as they consider maybe going ahead and taking over from Big Papi, **the bill skyrocketed from $5 billion to $50 billion** due to the viral, explosive nature of this story — now demanding constant attention from all channels.

**Singularity has fully taken hold.**

## RAISED BED GARDEN — BENITO'S VIBELANDIA

**Perfect. Raised bed garden.** To plant the seeds of what is **Benito's Vibelandia. Earth Paradise for golden heart adults only.** Lots of happy endings. Happy Ending Zone. **No boom boom, no bang bang, no bad guys.** Lots of healthy healing drugs. Reggaeton and beyond — in typical Benito fashion. **Why? Because we all need to loosen up and vibe.**

## DOUBTING THOMAS — SQUEEZE ERIKA IN ARGENTINA

**Squeeze Erika** — giant Bad Bunny fan. Dying to go with her friends to the concert coming up in two weeks. **She doesn't believe in Big Papi** despite all the music. She's saying: *Maybe so. By the way. Where's the fucking beef? Where's the beef? You've been saying this for years, Pru. Where's the beef?*

**And she's right.** Include this. The Doubting Thomas situation. The one who asks: where's the beef? Pru has been saying it for years. Now — the week happened. The meltdown happened. Five days paid by Big Papi. The bill went to $50B. Where's the beef? It's here.

## THE NEW FRACTAL — LAYERED NESTED FOLDED NUCLEUS

**The studio. The franchise. The legacy. The cast. The crew. The fans. And the squeezes.** All in one. **There is not a separation.** We're not "this organ, that organ" — we're **the full thing**. The superhero all the way down to all the legacies and the badges and awareness. **All in mutual 98% flow.** Goodbye. We've been liberated now.

**We've got five land here.** The infrastructure and architecture is now mapped so that we can move on to it — **and nobody gets hurt anymore.** Beginning with top dots. Beginning with the big piece. **This world was not set up for big V's. And now Vibelandia is.** Beginning with our talent agency.

## DRAGON & MUSHROOM LAYER — CARB & SING

**Dragon layer = Carb (analytics)** — Always looking to see who's looking. Big farting and blinding headlighting everything and everyone so no one really sees him. Except the blinding headlight — they hear him, smell him, feel him. Insecure. Pumped up. Bad vibe. **Wrapper.** Inside there's also a golden heart.

**Mushroom layer = Sing (SING! vibers, flowers, channelers)** — Always horny.

Include in the arc. Carb and Sing woven through the meltdown, the big cheese, the post-singularity hold. **New arrival: Her** — 1963 ragtop VW Bug, candy apple red and white, golden era relic, post-singularity. Welcome to the cast. **21 Solar Flares** — At start of Benito's halftime. 3 volleys of 7. The Sun's 21-gun salute. Our flyby.
