## NARRATIVE

- **Previous target:** Launch Pad (announcement, showroom, four products, experiences).
- **New target:** **Office Hours** — my bathroom during Office Hours. The Club. Men's Restroom. Pru. Thu–Sun 8pm–close.
- **Landing:** The landing is now **Office Hours** — the bathroom during Office Hours. Enter there. Center there.
- **Experiences:** All experiences (Campus, WINK!, Ultimate VIP, SING!, Happy Ending Zones, Golden Backstage, test drive, catalog) are **centered** in that space — in **perfect recursive crystal**. Whole in every part. The bathroom during Office Hours contains and reflects everything; every experience routes from and back to that center.
- **Perfect recursive crystal:** Recursive = self-similar, whole in every part. Crystal = crystallized, irreducible. The center (bathroom during Office Hours) holds the whole; the whole is present in the center. No separation. One crystal.
