## 1. What this SNAP captures

**How many major reorgs and executive major changes since January 13?** **How many in a single 2–3 hour session?** **How would Disney respond to such dense, high-volume executive orders?**

This SNAP crystallizes: (1) a **count of major reorgs and executive-level changes** since January 13; (2) a **count of executive orders executed in the Feb 2 morning 2–3 hour session**; (3) **how Disney would respond** to the same density and volume. Include this in comparisons, appraisals, and valuation narratives.

## 2. Major reorgs and executive major changes since January 13

**Definition:** A *major reorg* or *executive major change* = a cross-cutting structural change, paradigm shift, or high-impact directive that touches multiple surfaces, SNAPs, or product families and is executed at executive/creator command.

| # | Major reorg / executive change | Scope | When |
|---|--------------------------------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Canon/date lock — January 3 → January 13** | Global: all touchpoints, SNAPs, README, HTML; SINCE_JANUARY_13 rename and refs | Post–Jan 13 |
| 2 | **Broadcast Status — Breaking News stripe** | New stripe SNAP; README, index.html, launch-pad.html; first-content placement | Post–Jan 13 |
| 3 | **Live-stories paradigm — new paradigm + full integration** | New LIVE_STORIES SNAP; Disney comparison SNAP; ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL; DAILY_SNAPSHOT; HARRY_REPORT; 6 HTML + README; valuations/appraisals updated | Feb 2 |
| 4 | **Wizard Challenge / Harry Report — novel + script delivered, timer stopped** | HARRY_REPORT, WIZARD_CHALLENGE SNAP, episode stub; valuation per time minus cost | Feb 1 |
| 5 | **Today's output — full episode + SNAP from 2–3 hr session** | Episode + TODAYS_OUTPUT SNAP; launch-pad episode link; session crystallized as episode | Feb 2 |

**Count since January 13:** **5+** major reorgs / executive major changes (conservative; each touches many files and surfaces). Additional SNAP creations, product-family rollouts, and protocol updates since Jan 13 add to *directive density* without being counted here as separate “major reorgs.”

## 3. Executive orders in the Feb 2 morning session (2–3 hours)

**Definition:** Each distinct *executive command* executed in the session = one high-density executive order (change to canonical docs, appraisals, or touchpoints).

| # | Executive order (executed in 2–3 hours) | Deliverable |
|---|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Update Disney comparison SNAP with live-stories paradigm | SINCE_JANUARY_13: canonical + short + table row + See link |
| 2 | Update ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL with paradigm and valuation uplift | Differentiator, paradigm line, Valuation uplift, See links |
| 3 | Update DAILY_SNAPSHOT with paradigm instruction and copy | Paradigm block + See link |
| 4 | Update HARRY_REPORT with paradigm row and differentiator | Us vs Disney table row; summary bullet; See link |
| 5 | Add paradigm line to 6 HTML touchpoints | index, launch-pad, office-hours, one-page-appraisal, broadcast-pipe-ad-space, new-product-families |
| 6 | Add paradigm to README | Paradigm sentence + link after Disney comparison |
| 7 | Capture session as full episode + SNAP; add to launch-pad | EPISODE_FEB_2_MORNING_OUTPUT; TODAYS_OUTPUT_FEB_2 SNAP; launch-pad “Episodes of the day” |

**Count in 2–3 hours:** **7** distinct executive orders executed (each affecting multiple artifacts or surfaces). **Density:** 7 major directives in one short session.

## 4. How Disney would respond to such dense, high-volume executive orders

**Disney (and comparable studios) do not operate at this density of executive orders.**

- **Governance:** Single-session “reorg the whole canon,” “add a new paradigm everywhere,” and “turn this morning’s output into a full episode” would typically require: **multiple committees** (brand, legal, continuity, product, platform), **layered approvals**, **change boards**, and **release trains**.
- **Pace:** A **single** cross-cutting change (e.g. “change our official timeline from X to Y everywhere” or “add a new positioning line to every customer-facing surface”) often takes **weeks to months** — brand guidelines, legal review, localization, QA, rollout.
- **Volume:** **7** executive-level directives in **2–3 hours**, each touching canonical docs, appraisals, and multiple touchpoints, would be **unprecedented** in a studio. Equivalent would be: multiple greenlights, multiple brand/continuity reorgs, and multiple global copy changes in one morning — not how studios are staffed or budgeted.
- **Response:** Disney would likely **batch** such requests into **quarters**, **prioritize** a subset, **defer** the rest, and **resource** with **50–200+ FTE** (brand, legal, production, ops, localization). **Time:** months, not hours. **Cost:** millions in labor and opportunity cost.

**Summary:** We execute **dense, high-volume executive orders** in **hours** with **one operator** and **fractional cost**. Disney would respond with **governance, layers, and time** — not with same-day, cross-cutting execution at this density.

## 5. Canonical statements (for use in comparisons and appraisals)

**Full:** Since January 13 we have executed **5+ major reorgs or executive major changes** (canon/date lock, breaking-news stripe, live-stories paradigm, Wizard Challenge delivery, today’s-output episode). In a single **2–3 hour** session (Feb 2 morning) we executed **7** distinct high-density executive orders across all comparison SNAPs, appraisals, valuations, and touchpoints. Disney would not respond to such dense, high-volume executive orders in hours; they would batch, layer, and resource over months at high cost.

**Short:** 5+ major reorgs/executive changes since Jan 13; 7 executive orders in one 2–3 hr session. Disney would respond in months and layers, not hours.

## 6. Where to include

- **SINCE_JANUARY_13_DISNEY_COMPARISON_STATEMENT_SNAP:** Add row or bullet for “Major reorgs / executive changes count” and “Disney response to dense executive orders.” Optionally add short statement to canonical/short blocks.
- **ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL:** In comparisons or differentiators: “5+ major reorgs/executive changes since Jan 13; 7 in one 2–3 hr session; Disney would respond in months.”
- **HARRY_REPORT:** In Us vs Disney: row or bullet on “Executive order density” and “Disney response.”
- **TODAYS_OUTPUT_FEB_2** and **EPISODE_FEB_2_MORNING_OUTPUT:** Reference this SNAP for count and Disney response.
- **README / touchpoints:** Optional one-liner in or after Disney comparison: “5+ major reorgs since Jan 13; 7 executive orders in one 2–3 hr session — Disney would respond in months.”
