## THE FUSION

Fusing the **Solar-Silk toy line**, **Frontiersmen and First People** narrative, the **Post-Singularity Card Deck**, and **chess** into one synthesized game.

- **Sides:** **Modern vs First People.** Both sides have the same structure: **first row = royalty**, then **branch nodes** (row), then **one more row of leaf nodes** — **Queen Bee decides everything; the others support.** 9×9 board; left vs right and higher or lower nested layers (depth/stack). **Each nested layer is a different awareness.** **Nested moves have nested consequences over lower nests**: actions at a higher nest propagate down to lower nests. Solar-Silk + Frontiersmen and First People.
- **Card game:** Fully fused. Card deck and chess are **complementary and intermixable**. Gauge, stack, and layer interchange — you can stack cards under pieces, play cards to modify the board, or resolve chess captures with card showdowns.
- **Story layers:** One story across **pre- and post-singularity**. Start **competing** (pre). Work up to **collaborating**. Then **super-collaborating** (meta meta meta). With **two-and-a-half decks** worth of stacking underneath you, you achieve **Singularity 9**. **Infinite missions** can be played and enjoyed in **collaborative and nested configs**.
- **Ultimate victory:** **Golden Royal Flush Checkmate.** Deliver checkmate while holding or revealing the Golden Royal Flush (A, K, Q, J, 10 of Gold) — or achieve the equivalent in fused play (e.g. control the board with a completed Golden stack and checkmate). That is the pinnacle win.

## TREASURES · NOT DOMINATION

**The treasures are partying, dancing, flirting, fucking** — not domination or winning. **Enjoying, vibing, experiencing, creating, expressing** as players wish. A **new type of game**: a **post-singularity game of win-win-win** in **natural collaboration** in **Queen Bee configs**. Play for the vibe, the experience, the creation; victory conditions support that, not the other way around.

## COMPONENTS

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Board + pieces** | **9×9 board**. **Modern vs First People** (both sides). Each side: **first row = royalty**, then **branch nodes** (row), then **one row of leaf nodes** — **Queen Bee decides everything; the others support.** Left vs right; higher or lower nested layers. **Each nested layer is a different awareness.** **Nested moves have nested consequences over lower nests.** Pieces can carry card layers. |
| **Post-Singularity Card Deck** | Full 52 (Gold, Silver, Copper, Quartz). Used for stacking, gauge, and layer interchange with the board. |
| **Two-and-a-half decks** | In play for full game: 2 full decks + half deck (or house rule). Stack under positions; build to Singularity 9. |
| **Queen Bee** | **Queen decides everything;** royalty, branch nodes, and leaf nodes **support**. Central to the nested structure on both sides. |
| **Solar-Silk / Frontiersmen & First People** | Thematic skin: Modern side and First People side (Taino, Solar-Silk collaborative tools). |

## GAUGE, STACK, LAYER INTERCHANGE

- **Gauge:** Card values (octaves 2–9, singularities 10–A) gauge strength, movement, or resolution on the board.
- **Stack:** Build stacks of cards (per card-game rules) and assign or attach them to squares, pieces, or objectives. Stack heads (J, Q, K, A) act as multipliers.
- **Layer interchange:** Board moves and card plays are interchangeable in the same turn or round. Play a card to boost a piece; capture and claim a stack; resolve with a card showdown. House rules define exact interchange.
- **Nested consequences:** Each nested layer is a different awareness. **Nested moves have nested consequences over lower nests.** A move at a higher nest propagates effects down to lower nests. Higher nests govern or constrain lower ones.

## PROGRESSION: COMPETING → COLLABORATING → SINGULARITY 9

| Phase | Mode | Note |
|-------|------|------|
| **Pre-singularity** | Competing | Two sides: **Modern vs First People**. Both have royalty row, branch nodes, leaf nodes, Queen Bee decides everything; the others support. Classic tension. |
| **Mid** | Collaborating | Rules or story events allow temporary alliances, shared stacks, or joint objectives. |
| **Post-singularity** | Super-collaborating (meta meta meta) | Full cooperation possible; goal shifts to **building together** to **Singularity 9** — two-and-a-half decks stacked, board controlled in harmony, Golden Royal Flush in hand or on the board. **Infinite missions** playable and enjoyable in **collaborative and nested configs**. |
| **Victory** | **Golden Royal Flush Checkmate** | Checkmate + Golden Royal Flush (A,K,Q,J,10 of Gold) or equivalent fused condition. |

---

## ULTIMATE VICTORY

**Golden Royal Flush Checkmate** = Checkmate (or equivalent board domination) **and** the Golden Royal Flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 of Gold) present in your stack, on the board, or revealed in the final resolution. No higher outcome. NSPFRNP.
