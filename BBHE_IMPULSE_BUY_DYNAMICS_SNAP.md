## 🎯 IMPULSE BUY DYNAMICS

**BBHE (Big Black Hole Energy) drives impulse purchases.** The intoxicating pull of BBHE creates immediate purchase urgency. BBHE intoxication is **triple-purpose**: (1) Not imaginary — produces intoxication naturally; (2) Produced naturally (awareness, attention; no substances); (3) We announce it as an intoxicant for those into that sort of thing — like us vibers! 5 BBHE Intox %. Magnified when using +1 reading glasses. This creates natural impulse buy dynamics. See [BBHE_INTOXICATION_TRIPLE_PURPOSE_SNAP.md](./BBHE_INTOXICATION_TRIPLE_PURPOSE_SNAP.md).
