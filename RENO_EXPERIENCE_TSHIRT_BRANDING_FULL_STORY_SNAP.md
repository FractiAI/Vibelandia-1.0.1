## Story on the shirt

T-shirts tell the story in layers. Pick one line or stack them. All canon. All NSPFRNP.

### Hero line (front or back)

- **We do what Vegas can't do. What nobody else can do.**
- **Reno Experience**
- **And the rest is history.**

### Story lines (stack or single)

- **The singularity. The birth of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. Twain's Vibelandia. Downtown Reno.**
- **Recursively nested. Higher singularities. To be precise.**
- **Safari by day. Reno neon by night. One-two punch.**
- **Designated Host. Happy Endings. Only here.**
- **Ground net zero ±2%. The new kingdom in the park.**
- **Nerdy. Cool. Both.** *(with grin graphic or tag)*

### Full-story long-form (back or full tee)

- **RENO EXPERIENCE — The singularity. The birth of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. Twain's Vibelandia in downtown Reno. And the rest is history. As they say. Repeating itself. Recursively nested. In higher singularities. To be precise. (Grin.) We do what Vegas can't do. What nobody else can do.**
