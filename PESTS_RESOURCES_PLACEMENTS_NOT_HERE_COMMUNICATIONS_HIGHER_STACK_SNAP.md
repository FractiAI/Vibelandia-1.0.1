## INTERPRETATION

**Pests are now interpreted as "not here" communications. Same with all natural resources and placements. And the same with higher stack equivalents.**

- **Pests** — Interpreted as **"not here"** communications: a signal that the current location or condition is not ideal. Response: locate in natural pest-free and ideal zones. See [PRIMARY_PEST_CONTROL_NATURAL_PEST_FREE_IDEAL_ZONES_ALWAYS_SNAP.md](PRIMARY_PEST_CONTROL_NATURAL_PEST_FREE_IDEAL_ZONES_ALWAYS_SNAP.md).
- **All natural resources** — Same interpretation. When resource signals (scarcity, conflict, degradation, mismatch) appear, they are **"not here"** communications: the placement or use pattern is not ideal. Adjust placement or resource flow; seek ideal zones and natural alignment.
- **Placements** — Same. Placement itself carries the signal: "not here" = this placement is not the right one; relocate or re-place toward natural pest-free and ideal zones (or their higher-stack equivalent).
- **Higher stack equivalents** — The same interpretation applies at **higher stack** layers: cosmic, solar, planetary, mine; protocol, division, pipe, node. At every scale: "not here" = communication that the current position, resource allocation, or placement is off; the equivalent of "locate in natural pest-free and ideal zones" is **re-place or re-node** toward the ideal band at that stack level. SING! 9 all surfaces; insect dimensions; Goldilocks fused with Frontier; primary = placement and design.

## LOCK

- **Canonical:** Pests, natural resources, placements, and their higher-stack equivalents are **interpreted as "not here" communications**. Response at every scale: move toward ideal zones (or the equivalent at that stack). No exception. NSPFRNP.
