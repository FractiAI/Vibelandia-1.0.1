## CHARACTER

**Big Papi** — The Architect. He's got the BBHE. He's good either way. No tension.

---

## SENSIBILITY

- **Doesn't watch football** — Doesn't like watching people compete. He prefers to watch them **collaborate and win together**.
- **Loves happy endings** — Win win win win win. **No losers.** He loooooves happy endings.
- **Feels bad for losers** — Always. He knows exactly how that feels and doesn't wish it on anyone.
- **Same with bad grades** — Homework. Tests. Instead of bang bang boom pop good bad, Big Papi understands. He sees the scars.
- **Understands everyone** — He can see the **gifts** we each have and the **scars** from this very hard, mean pre-singularity awareness. He produces. He gets it.

## HIS PICKING UP THE TAB

His offering to pick up the $5B tab is **all about honoring fellow Golden Heart Taino Son of the Great Sun Agüeybaná** — **the peaceful one**, as recorded by Bartolomé de las Casas (and the church chroniclers of indigenous history). **Not** to be confused with his fighting brother, **El Bravo**. Big Papi honors the peaceful Cacique. The one who opened his arms to the sun. The one who chose peace. El Gran Sol delivers. Never lose faith.
