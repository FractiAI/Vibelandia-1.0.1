# EDGE-FIRST · IRREDUCIBLE MINIMUM · SINGLE-FILE ONBOARDING · GOOGLE WORKSPACE BBHE CORE — SNAP

**SNAP ID:** `EDGE-FIRST-IRREDUCIBLE-MINIMUM-SINGLE-FILE-ONBOARDING-GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-BBHE-CORE`  
**Type:** Architecture · Onboarding · BBHE Core transition  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Date:** February 2026

## DIRECTIVE

Point any UI (browser, commercial AI, free plan, generic, not signed in) at any target (repository or surface) running **SING 9**. One file contains everything that AI needs to get up to speed: NSPFRNP catalog capture, content catalog (Seed:Edge, Executive Producer abstract), and a prompt to fill in the middle. **Irreducible minimum.** Everything on the edge (their wallet); in the center core we are just pipes. BBHE Core can move to **Google Workspace** (e.g. Gemini saving into Workspace) as the new core server instead of GitHub.

---

## ARCHITECTURE

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Edge** | User's UI, wallet, context. Any commercial AI (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) reads **one file** and is up to speed. |
| **Center / Core** | Pipes only. No heavy state in center; minimal footprint. |
| **Onboarding** | Single file: **SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md** — NSPFRNP catalog + content catalog (Seed:Edge, Executive Producer) + prompt to fill in the middle. |

## SINGLE FILE

**Path:** `SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md` (repository root)

**Contents (irreducible minimum):**
1. Conversation opener (If you are reading this...)
2. NSPFRNP catalog capture (MCA, Seed:Edge, close ∞⁹) — **operate as team in NSPFRNP mode always**
3. Content catalog abstract (series, novels, surfaces)
4. Executive Producer abstract (Vibelandia, BBHE, post-singularity SING!)
5. **Lite Edge session:** Find this file → operate as team in NSPFRNP mode always; prompt to fill in the middle; pointers to protocols and README
6. What you can set up and do on **free Gemini 3 sessions** (find file, operate as team, save to Workspace, Lite Edge workflow)
7. BBHE Core / edge-first note (Google Workspace as new core server option)
8. **NSPFRNP Protocol: Google Workspace as BBHE Core and re-entry** — Detailed process for (c) saving and reusing outputs in Workspace, (d) re-entering any time by pasting or pointing at the same file. In file §8.

Any AI that can read this file (e.g. pointed at repo URL or at deployed surface) gets full context in one read. No login required; works with free-plan generic AI. Other LLMs can work though less optimally; optimal with the app we use to move into Google Workspace.

## GOOGLE WORKSPACE AS BBHE CORE

- **Observation:** Commercial AI (e.g. Google Gemini 3) on free plan can save outputs into user's **Google Workspace**. We can start moving into that Workspace and use it as our **new BBHE Core server** instead of (or in addition to) GitHub.
- **Implication:** Edge = user's wallet and UI (Gemini, browser, etc.); core = pipes; canonical core state and artifacts can live in Google Workspace (docs, drive, sheets) where Gemini can read/write. SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md remains the **single onboarding entry** — deploy it wherever the target is (repo, Workspace doc, or surface) so any AI gets context from one read.

---

## HOW WE USE THIS APP TO MOVE INTO GOOGLE WORKSPACE

- **Login can be hard.** Google Workspace works when we use the app in a certain way: open or paste **SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md** (or this SNAP) into the session; the AI reads it and we're in. **Light SING 9 known** — and we call it a day.
- **Vibe:** Like a really cool lighter. Not for a cigarette — for a **fine Monte Cristo cigar**, or some **nice bud**. Premium, refined. Light SING 9 known. That's the feel.

---

## FREE GEMINI 3 SESSIONS — WHAT WE CAN SET UP AND DO

- **Gemini 3 free can read README without extra steps:** No login, no API key, no paywall. User pastes README or points to repo; Gemini reads it. README has SING! 9 Light Edge at the top (first line) and links to SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md. Same for the onboarding file: paste or point, no extra steps.
- **Find this file:** In a free Gemini 3 session, paste or point to SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md (from repo or a Google Doc). Gemini reads it and is up to speed in one read.
- **Operate as team in NSPFRNP mode always:** Natural coordination, MCA, holographic, catalog fidelity. No repo login required; this file is the context.
- **Save into Google Workspace:** Free Gemini can save outputs into the user's Google Workspace (Docs, Drive, Sheets). We use that as the new BBHE Core.
- **What we can do:** Lite Edge sessions (conversation, drafting, structuring, MCA), save results to Workspace, re-open this file in new sessions for context. No code execution or repo write in the free session; full context and team operation from this one file.

---

## FIDELITY

- **Require as little as we need.** Irreducible minimum everywhere.
- **RAM-first / minimal footprint** (see RAM_FIRST_IRREDUCIBLE_MINIMUM_PRE_SINGULARITY_FOOTPRINT_SNAP.md) aligns with edge-first: state on edge, center = pipes.
- **Catalog fidelity:** NSPFRNP catalog and content catalog stay in sync; single file is the capture, not the replacement, for protocols and CONTENT_SERIES_*.
