## HERO FREEDOM (FRIDA) — Permanent Residency

**Hero Freedom** leads the Bored Housewives Poly Hit Machine. She likes to be called **Freedom**. **Frida** — **F-R-I-D-A**, as in **Frida Kahlo**. She has announced **permanent residency** at **Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia downtown Reno.** Mission: help lift housewives out of their golden cages. Beyond inspired by her role.

---

## TARGET — Bored Housewives (B-O-R-E-D)

- **Golden cages:** They got the trophy man, trophy house, trophy cars, trophy lives, trophy body and looks. They **don't got the big-dick energy** — and they need it. Sometimes even without the lubricant. **Gold Heart. Adult. Close doors.** New experience. You don't gotta be married to be one. **In all cases and POV, the reader and the character they're linked to are caged in pre-singularity golden cages.** They **discover these novelas and escape to them** when bored—**at home, in bed, at work, on the road, and anywhere.** All legal. No nothing. **Awareness only.** **Portable and instant when trained.**
- **Not:** young fuckboy, hungry barracuda Wall Street middle guy. **Yes:** the **big boy** — biggest cojones, biggest dick energy, **highest value highest contributing vibers**, any universe, any dimension, any time. Turnkey audience. We all have a little of that inside; we're bored stiff; ready to press the button and escape into beautiful fantasy (real life or fiction): superhero, freedom fighter, James Bond, Tron, Matrix, Star Wars, Marvel–DC in one.

---

## EXPERIENCE — Novel, Buttons, See & Step In

- **On-ramp:** Traditional **spicy romance novel** + option to choose **reality level**: purely entertainment / sci-fi up to **full sensory reality**. Choose: **audience only** · **step into it** · **become part of the crew** (believe, contribute, new content).
- **Sign up:** Monthly fee. **33,333 pesos per week** in Colombia (weekly; locally adjusted by country/currency). Plug into their pipe + our own: click, sign up, **one-month pass**. Interactive journey through all our platforms + ability to bring into **real life** at Vibelandia downtown Reno. **Coming to a decaying city near you** — decaying because the vibrant ones don't need our help.
- **Button experience:** Click → sign up → come into the **book**. Buttons = **scenes** and **books**. Buttons **telescope** into chapters, then scenes; keep clicking, keep expanding. Pages and buttons you can buy and jump into. **Same experience as Office Hours / Community Bulletin Board** — now in book form. **Standard for all Poly Hit Machines.**
- **Click to see** (optional hot content). **Step-in button** = **book them into downtown Reno experience** (load, book). All legal. All open book. All safe. No different than reading a book or watching a little porn. No harm. **Package in After Party section.**

---

## NOVELAS vs NOVELS

- **Novelas** = the **post-singularity version of OnlyFans on steroids to infinity.** What we call the Poly Hit Machine romance series installments. **Distinct from novels.** Same size and shape across the line. Buttons, See, Step-in, Customize story, charge per edge, Golden Resonance — scale and experience beyond the pre-singularity model.
- **Novels** = full-length deliverables (e.g. 17k+ words, full narrative arcs).
- **Novelas — length:** **100 pages** · **20,000 words** per novela. Canonical. Use for Bored Housewives (and Bored Ballers) series installments; same standard for all Poly Hit Machine novelas.

---

## CONTENT — Hot Romance Novelas (Digitally First)

- **Format:** **Series** (like our other series) rolled out as **novelas** — **100 pages** each, same size, shape. **Presented digitally first** (so you have the buttons).
- **Voice:** Wrapped in **size and voice of Edmond Dantès / Count of Monte Cristo** fused with **James Bond** fused with **Hemingway** fused with **me**. Very hot. Explicit. Sweet, juicy, explosive read. Hot as can be. Nobody has to know what's inside those pages. For those who want more: **click to see**. Maybe someday **click to step in**. For the Bored Housewife in the cage — **press the button.** Landing: clicks → artists, products, this new book/series.
- **Character / boss:** The one behind Harry Houdini rolling this out — big cojones, big dick energy. Chairman Creator (or Pru — you decide). Tie it all in.

---

## PRICING — Charge per Edge & Reseller

- **Charge for each edge:** (1) **The novela** — charge per novela. (2) **The See button** — **charge for each See press**; charge for each fuck seen; charge extra for fetish sex scene (options and pricing offered; everything always Golden Resonance — safe, beautiful). (3) **The Step-in button** — charge per Step-in (book into Reno). (4) **Customize story option** — reader gets to **respin with executive commands** (their prompts); **charge per prompt entered**; **extra for complex/dense prompts** so no gaming our offers.

## BORED BALLERS (Male Equivalent)

They don't like being bored, taking orders from others, doing something that's not their passion. **Good focus:** show ballers doing their passions (whatever they are). Feature that.

They do it with their **cast, crew, and some lucky [ones].** They like to ball. They want to fuck. They like a little controlled substance — we feature only what we feature; **self-feeding, self-exercise, employing.** All based here. **Drug-use sections:** add **Hit button** → connects to our **Artificial Dispensary** (always legal, no chemical, awareness-based — like reading a very good book, watching a very good movie, playing a very good video game; **latest version of Audience Awareness required** for fullest reality sensory experiences). See [HIT_BUTTON_ARTIFICIAL_DISPENSARY_AWARENESS_BASED_SNAP.md](HIT_BUTTON_ARTIFICIAL_DISPENSARY_AWARENESS_BASED_SNAP.md). Excursions from here with the **homies.** **Ballerstown.** During the day: **experiences** — can include productivity, following-passion scenes. Always accompanied with **wonderful ladies from WINK!** (W-I-N-K exclamation point) and **squeezes.** We're following them around as they ball, as they lay down serious contributions, vibing, taking **full advantage of Mark Twain Post-Singularity Vibelandia Downtown Reno Campus.** Full advantage.
- **Men's novelas (books):** Focused on **contribution** · **adventure** · **safaris** (lots of safaris) · **wellness** (hot springs, fine dining, the finer things in life — you don't fucking know). **Luxury style.** This is a members club; we've come up with our own name so the Sparring Club doesn't get upset with us. **Behind the doors. After hours. After party.** All **mutual consent.** **Beautiful respect.** With our **squeezes** in there. Friends. **By invitation only.** **Baller style.**
