## STRATEGY — HOW WE GET THERE

- **MCA** — Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. Every asset and surface runs through this cycle.
- **NSPFRNP** — Natural coordination, mirrored hardened shells, catalog fidelity. Holographic: whole in every part.
- **Seed:Edge** — Origin (Seed) and experience (Edge). Flip the stack; thin clients, compute upstream.
- **Layer and amplify** — We don't compete or take away. Our pricing: our layer on top (e.g. 100% tip on actual or partner spend). Natural approach; referral and designated host for the benefit of all.
