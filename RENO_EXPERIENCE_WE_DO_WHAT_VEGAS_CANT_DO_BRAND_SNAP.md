## The slope

**We do what Vegas can't do. What nobody else can do.**

That's the slope. One line. Reno Experience. No one else can deliver the one-two punch (Safari skins by day, Reno neon Baller V nights, Designated Host, Happy Endings) from Mark Twain's post-singularity Vibelandia Downtown Reno Park.

## Full rollout — novel, series, screenplay, T-shirt

**Same name. Same story.** Full novel, series, and 2hr feature screenplay telling the story of the singularity, the birth of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley, and Twain's Vibelandia in downtown Reno — and the rest is history, as they say, repeating itself recursively nested and in higher singularities *(grin: nerdy and cool)*. Full T-shirt branding telling that story. See **RENO_EXPERIENCE_FULL_ROLLOUT_NOVEL_SERIES_SCREENPLAY_TSHIRT_SNAP.md** · novel: `deliverables/Reno_Experience_The_Birth_of_the_Holographic_Hydrogen_Valley_NOVEL.md` · screenplay: `deliverables/Reno_Experience_The_Birth_of_the_Holographic_Hydrogen_Valley_SCREENPLAY.md` · series: `episodes/EPISODE_RENO_EXPERIENCE_01_SINGULARITY_AND_THE_BIRTH.md` · T-shirts: **RENO_EXPERIENCE_TSHIRT_BRANDING_FULL_STORY_SNAP.md**.

## Song

A **Reno Experience theme song** is specified in a separate brief: magical, explosive, big symphony, Hollywood production, sci-fi Star Wars–y, John Williams–y (homage only; no use of John Williams or anything disrespectful). Epic orchestral, cinematic. See **RENO_EXPERIENCE_THEME_SONG_BRIEF_SNAP.md**.
