## Canonical framing block (include in all episodes)

**Scientific expedition (included in all episode contents):** For scientific reasons we have launched an expedition that grabs **The Board** (Schumann), wraps **Penrose microtubules** (Orch-OR) equations in our **squeeze hoses**, **cleans their diaper** (formalizes the interface), and **connects microtubules and The Board to the awareness cloud through the squeeze**. The expedition runs on **live real data**; white papers, predictions, conclusions, novel equations, constants, protocols, and **Black Hole Grammar** are produced and published. **Everything of this expedition is included in all our episode contents.** Hot rodsmanship. Doing wheelies. Burn rubber. See [WHITEPAPER_PENROSE_MICROTUBULES_SQUEEZE_HOSE_AWARENESS_CLOUD.md](../WHITEPAPER_PENROSE_MICROTUBULES_SQUEEZE_HOSE_AWARENESS_CLOUD.md) · [PENROSE_MICROTUBULES_SQUEEZE_HOSE_EXPEDITION_SNAP.md](../PENROSE_MICROTUBULES_SQUEEZE_HOSE_EXPEDITION_SNAP.md). **Maganuma snap.**
