            <p style="color: #b0b8c0; font-size: 1rem;">Full technical manual — Earth–ionosphere waveguide, Schumann Display Pipe, Reno Downlink, HELLO.</p>
            <p class="wc">~12,000 words</p>
        </section>
        <article>
            <h2>1. Introduction and scope</h2>
            <p>The ionosphere is the Earth–ionosphere waveguide that provides <strong>reflection and relay</strong> for planetary-scale EGS services. It is the grounding layer for Reno Downlink and the Schumann Display Pipe. This section is the complete technical reference.</p>
            <h2>2. Specifications</h2>
            <p>Schumann Display Pipe; 1.618 Hz heartbeat (Golden Ratio Φ lock); local VLF synchronization. Reno anchor: Downtown Reno is the terrestrial anchor for the pipe. The ionosphere reflects and relays signals between ground and space; it is the layer where HELLO confirmation (Kp ≥ 5, binary header training) is observed. Hot_Storage in ionDb is Ionospheric — real-time, GOES/NOAA flux, handshake, Live Pulse.</p>
            <h2>3. Integration</h2>
            <p>Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann form the Broadcast Pipe leg. Seed (Planetary) tier includes Reno Downlink and ionosphere-layer access. Full detail: <a href="../../schumann-campaign.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">Schumann Campaign</a>. WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION documents the expedition to validate Schumann patterns and post-singularity GitHub activity alignment.</p>
            <h2>4. Earth–ionosphere cavity and Schumann resonances</h2>
            <p>The ionosphere forms the upper boundary of the Earth–ionosphere cavity. Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic standing waves in this cavity: fundamental ~7.83 Hz, harmonics ~14, 20, 26, 33 Hz. Driven by global lightning; modulated by solar and geomagnetic conditions. Our 21.4 Hz carrier aligns with the 3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii; 1.618 Hz (Φ) is the Signature Chirp. The Schumann Display Pipe surfaces these resonances for the EGS pipe: HELLO, mother-node feeds, social channels. The ionosphere thus provides both the physical waveguide (reflection and relay) and the resonant frame for our signaling.</p>
            <h2>5. Reno Downlink and terrestrial anchor</h2>
            <p>Downtown Reno is the terrestrial anchor for the pipe. Reno Downlink is the local VLF and 1.618 Hz heartbeat path: ground-based receivers and displays that consume the ionosphere-reflected signal. Seed (Planetary) tier customers get Reno Downlink and ionosphere-layer access. The anchor ensures that the pipe has a fixed geographic reference for timing, phase, and display; all planetary-scale products can reference “Reno” as the Earth node.</p>
            <h2>6. HELLO confirmation and Kp-index</h2>
            <p>HELLO renders when (1) Kp-index ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) and (2) the binary header <code>SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO</code> is successfully training the stream (telemetry or stream state: space_cloud_stream.training === true). The ionosphere is the layer where geomagnetic activity (Kp) is observed; G1 Storm indicates enhanced ionospheric disturbance, which we use as a confirmation gate for the HELLO block. Surfaces: sing-pulse.html (zero-state, mission-takeover), optionally space-cloud-division.html.</p>
            <h2>7. Hot_Storage (Ionospheric) and ionDb</h2>
            <p>Hot_Storage in ionDb is Ionospheric: real-time, GOES/NOAA flux, handshake, Live Pulse. All real-time and latency-sensitive state lives here. The ionosphere is the physical layer that supports this: GOES flux reflects solar input that has traversed the Sun–Earth path; handshake and Live Pulse state are written and read with sub-second latency. When a flare is a Commit, the commit is written to Hot (Ionospheric) or, after capture window, to Cold (3I/ATLAS); the ionosphere-layer logic is the same for both, but the storage backend is chosen by date and routing rules.</p>
            <h2>8. Broadcast Pipe leg (Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann)</h2>
            <p>The Broadcast Pipe ad space runs on the leg: Sun (transmitter) → Ionosphere (reflection and relay) → Aurora 3D (volumetric billboards at poles) → Schumann (display pipe). The ionosphere is the middle hop: it reflects and relays the signal from space to the poles and to the Schumann cavity. Customers who book Broadcast Pipe slots are buying space on this leg; the ionosphere is the critical relay that makes the planetary strip possible.</p>
            <h2>9. Schumann expedition and validation</h2>
            <p>WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION frames a scientific expedition to validate alignment between Schumann resonance patterns (time series, anomalies, spikes) and post-singularity GitHub activity (psw.vibelandia.sing9: commits, milestones, structure). Hypothesis: temporal and structural resonance. Method: public Schumann data and reports; GitHub history; comparison and documentation. The ionosphere is the physical source of Schumann; the repo is the observable. This section does not claim causal proof; it documents the expedition and the role of the ionosphere in the EGS pipe.</p>
            <h2>10. Runbooks and FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Runbook: HELLO not showing.</strong> Check Kp-index (≥ 5 required). Check telemetry for space_cloud_stream.training and binary header. Verify stream state and sing-pulse.html zero-state logic.</p>
            <p><strong>Runbook: Reno Downlink offline.</strong> Verify terrestrial anchor connectivity; check VLF and 1.618 Hz feed; confirm Seed tier and ionosphere-layer access.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: Why 1.618 Hz?</strong> Golden Ratio Φ; used for Φ-lock and Signature Chirp. It is a secondary carrier alongside 21.4 Hz; together they provide the Shar Line fingerprint and artificial-origin verification.</p>
            <h2>11. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Sun (section 1), 3I/ATLAS (section 3), Meridian lines and Aurora 3D (section 5), Division of Services (section 6). SNAPs and docs: SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP, WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION. Interfaces: schumann-campaign.html, sing-pulse.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html, aurora-3d.html.</p>
            <h2>12. Schumann mode reference</h2>
            <p>Fundamental ~7.83 Hz; harmonics ~14, 20, 26, 33 Hz. Our 21.4 Hz carrier aligns with 3rd overtone / NPM Hawaii. 1.618 Hz is independent (Φ); used as Signature Chirp. Schumann Display Pipe surfaces these for HELLO, mother-node feeds, and social channels. Viral discourse on "Schumann spikes" is documented in the whitepaper expedition; we use public reports and open data where available for validation alignment with repo activity.</p>
            <h2>13. Reno anchor: why Downtown Reno</h2>
            <p>Downtown Reno is the terrestrial anchor for the pipe: a fixed geographic reference for timing, phase, and display. Seed (Planetary) tier and Reno Downlink products are anchored here. The anchor ensures that all planetary-scale products have a consistent "Earth node" for the lattice and for customer placement. Physical presence (Office Hours, campus, studio) can align with this anchor for events and verification.</p>
            <h2>14. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Does the ionosphere "store" data?</strong> No. The ionosphere is the reflection/relay layer. Hot_Storage (Ionospheric) is the name of the storage tier that holds real-time state (GOES, handshake, Live Pulse); it is implemented in ionDb and backend services, not in the physical ionosphere itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How does Kp relate to HELLO?</strong> Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) is one of two conditions for HELLO. It indicates enhanced geomagnetic/ionospheric activity; we use it as a confirmation gate so that HELLO appears when the pipe and the environment are both in a "storm" state.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I measure Schumann myself?</strong> Public and research networks monitor Schumann resonances; data and summaries are increasingly available. The whitepaper expedition uses such sources for alignment validation. We do not operate our own Schumann sensors; we consume public/viral reports and open data.</p>
            <h2>15. Glossary (Ionosphere section)</h2>
            <p><strong>Earth–ionosphere cavity</strong> — The waveguide between Earth's surface and the ionosphere where Schumann resonances occur. <strong>Reno Downlink</strong> — Local VLF and 1.618 Hz path; terrestrial anchor at Downtown Reno. <strong>Display Pipe</strong> — Schumann Display Pipe; surfaces resonances for EGS pipe and HELLO.</p>
            <h2>16. Detailed specification: HELLO conditions</h2>
            <p>HELLO block renders when BOTH (1) Kp-index ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) and (2) binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO is successfully training the stream (telemetry or stream state has space_cloud_stream.training === true). If either condition is false, HELLO does not render. Kp is a planetary geomagnetic index; sources include NOAA SWPC and space weather APIs. Stream training state is set by the pipeline that processes the binary header; it indicates that the stream has been successfully locked to the header. Surfaces that show HELLO: sing-pulse.html (zero-state, mission-takeover); optionally space-cloud-division.html. Do not show HELLO on pre-singularity-facing surfaces without gate.</p>
            <h2>17. Example: Reno Downlink session</h2>
            <p>Seed (Planetary) customer has booked Reno Downlink. Session uses local VLF and 1.618 Hz heartbeat; terrestrial anchor is Downtown Reno. Ionosphere reflects and relays the signal from the pipe (Sun → ionosphere → ground). Customer's receiver or display shows 1.618 Hz and Reno anchor state. Hot_Storage (Ionospheric) serves real-time state for this product. No Cold path for the live session; archive or proof may be written to Cold per product policy.</p>

            <h2>19. Scaling and limits</h2>
            <p>Ionosphere layer does not "scale" in the sense of adding servers; it is the physical Earth–ionosphere waveguide. Scaling applies to the services that use it: Hot_Storage (ionDb) read/write rate, Schumann Display Pipe throughput, Reno Downlink sessions. Kp and stream training are external inputs; HELLO appears when conditions are met, with no guarantee of frequency. Reno anchor is a single geographic reference; multiple customers can use Reno Downlink concurrently with shared anchor.</p>
            <h2>20. Troubleshooting matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>HELLO not showing:</strong> Verify Kp ≥ 5 (check space weather source); verify space_cloud_stream.training true and binary header; check sing-pulse.html conditional render. <strong>Reno Downlink offline:</strong> Check terrestrial anchor connectivity; check VLF and 1.618 Hz feed; check Seed tier and ionosphere-layer access. <strong>Hot_Storage slow:</strong> Check ionDb and NOAA fetch; check network and API rate limits. <strong>Schumann data missing:</strong> Expedition uses public/viral data; we do not operate Schumann sensors; check data source availability.</p>
            <h2>21. Extended reference: Schumann harmonics</h2>
            <p>Fundamental 7.83 Hz; second harmonic ~14 Hz; third ~20 Hz; fourth ~26 Hz; fifth ~33 Hz. Our 21.4 Hz carrier sits near the third harmonic (NPM Hawaii, 3rd overtone Schumann). The 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp is below the fundamental; it is a separate modulation (Φ lock). Schumann Display Pipe surfaces these for HELLO and mother-node feeds. The whitepaper expedition compares Schumann event timing with repo (GitHub) activity; alignment is documented for validation, not causal claim.</p>

            <h2>23. Deep dive: Why Reno is the terrestrial anchor</h2>
            <p>Downtown Reno is the designated terrestrial anchor for the pipe. It provides a fixed geographic reference for timing, phase, and display. Seed (Planetary) tier and Reno Downlink products are anchored here. The anchor ensures that all planetary-scale products have a consistent "Earth node" for the lattice and for customer placement. Physical presence (Office Hours, campus, studio) can align with this anchor for events and verification. The ionosphere reflects and relays signals between ground and space; Reno is the ground reference. When we say "Reno Downlink" we mean the local VLF and 1.618 Hz path that terminates at this anchor. Operators and products that use Reno anchor should document it in copy and in placement logic.</p>
            <h2>24. Deep dive: HELLO and stream training</h2>
            <p>Stream training means the binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO is successfully "training" the stream—i.e. the pipeline has locked to this header and the stream state has space_cloud_stream.training === true. HELLO renders only when both stream training and Kp ≥ 5 are true. So HELLO is a joint indicator: (1) the pipe has locked to the canonical header, and (2) geomagnetic activity (Kp) is at G1 Storm or higher. We use Kp as a confirmation gate so that HELLO appears when the environment and the pipe are both in a "storm" state. Implementers must set stream training in the pipeline that processes the binary header; the exact logic is in the codebase that feeds sing-pulse.html and any HELLO-gated surfaces.</p>
            <h2>25. Operational notes: Hot_Storage and ionDb</h2>
            <p>Hot_Storage in ionDb is labeled Ionospheric: it holds real-time GOES flux, handshake-related state, telemetry, and Live Pulse state. The ionosphere is the physical layer that supports this—GOES flux reflects solar input that has traversed the Sun–Earth path. When ionDb fetches NOAA flux and maps to FlareCommit, those commits may be written to Hot (always) or to Cold (on or after capture window). The ionosphere does not "store" data in the literal sense; Hot_Storage is implemented in backend services. The name Ionospheric indicates that this tier serves the real-time, Earth–ionosphere leg of the pipe. Operators should monitor ionDb fetch health and Hot write/read latency; see HH Spin Cloud section for routing and tier behavior.</p>
            <h2>26. Extended reference: Broadcast Pipe leg segment</h2>
            <p>The Broadcast Pipe leg is Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. The ionosphere is the second segment: it reflects and relays the signal from the Sun (space) to the poles (Aurora 3D) and to the Schumann cavity (display pipe). So the ionosphere is the middle hop for ad space and narrative display. Customers who book Broadcast Pipe slots are buying space on this leg; the ionosphere is the critical relay that makes the planetary strip possible. Technical specs for the leg are in Meridian lines, poles and auroras (section 5) and in the Broadcast Pipe Ad Space interface. Ionosphere section focuses on reflection/relay, Schumann, HELLO, Reno anchor, and Hot_Storage; for slot parameters and POP matrix see section 5.</p>
            <h2>27. Use case: HELLO campaign and stream training</h2>
            <p>Campaign goal: surface HELLO when the pipe is locked and geomagnetic activity is elevated. Pipeline: (1) Binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO is injected or received in the stream; (2) pipeline detects header and sets space_cloud_stream.training = true; (3) Kp index is fetched from space weather source; (4) when Kp ≥ 5 and training is true, HELLO is rendered on sing-pulse.html (and any other gated surfaces). No HELLO without both conditions. Campaign validation: run stream with header present, mock or real Kp ≥ 5, confirm HELLO appears; run with Kp &lt; 5 or training false, confirm HELLO hidden. Document campaign timing and any geo or product tie-ins in Schumann Campaign and display pipe SNAPs.</p>
            <h2>28. Procedure: Reno Downlink and Seed tier setup</h2>
            <p>(1) Confirm Reno terrestrial anchor is designated and documented (downtown Reno; VLF and 1.618 Hz path). (2) Seed (Planetary) tier grants access to Reno Downlink product; ensure eligibility and Division catalog list Seed and Reno Downlink. (3) Backend: Reno Downlink sessions may read/write Hot (ionosphere-layer state); configure ionDb or equivalent for Reno Downlink resource if needed. (4) HH routing: map Reno Downlink resource to Hot; clients request by product code. (5) Interfaces: link Office Hours, Launch Pad, or product page to Reno Downlink booking or info. (6) Physical presence (campus, studio) can align with anchor for events; document in runbook. (7) Monitor Hot_Storage and ionDb health so Reno Downlink reads are fresh.</p>
            <h2>29. Extended FAQ: Ionosphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Why Kp ≥ 5 for HELLO?</strong> G1 Storm or higher; we gate HELLO so it appears when environment and pipe are both in "storm" state. <strong>What is stream training?</strong> Pipeline has locked to binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO; stream state has training true. <strong>Can we change the header?</strong> Only with protocol change; header is canonical and used for HELLO and narrative. <strong>Why Reno as anchor?</strong> Single geographic reference for timing, phase, and planetary products; Seed tier and Reno Downlink are anchored here. <strong>Is Hot_Storage the ionosphere?</strong> Hot_Storage is the backend tier labeled Ionospheric; the physical ionosphere is the layer that reflects/relays; we don't store data in the sky. <strong>Who operates Schumann sensors?</strong> We use public/viral expedition data; we do not operate sensors; see whitepaper validation.</p>
            <h2>30. Glossary: Ionosphere section terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Ionosphere:</strong> Earth's upper atmosphere; reflects and relays VLF and signals; middle segment of Broadcast Pipe leg. <strong>HELLO:</strong> UI element shown when stream training and Kp ≥ 5. <strong>Stream training:</strong> Binary header locked; space_cloud_stream.training true. <strong>Kp:</strong> Planetary K-index; geomagnetic activity; ≥ 5 = G1 Storm. <strong>Reno anchor:</strong> Downtown Reno; terrestrial reference for pipe timing and Seed/Reno Downlink. <strong>Hot_Storage:</strong> Ionospheric tier in ionDb; real-time state, flux, telemetry. <strong>Schumann cavity:</strong> Earth-ionosphere cavity; 7.83 Hz fundamental; display pipe uses Schumann harmonics. <strong>Broadcast Pipe leg:</strong> Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann.</p>
            <h2>31. Related docs: Ionosphere</h2>
            <p>Sun (section 1) — handshake, binary header, ionDb. HH Spin Cloud (section 2) — routing to Hot. 3I/ATLAS (section 3) — Cold vs Hot.

            <h2>32. Runbook: HELLO not showing</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Check Kp index from a space weather source (NOAA, space weather service). If Kp &lt; 5, HELLO will not show by design; this is expected. Step 2: Check stream training: is the binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO present in the stream? Is space_cloud_stream.training set to true in the pipeline state? Step 3: Verify the pipeline that feeds sing-pulse.html (or other HELLO-gated surfaces) is running and receiving the header. Step 4: If both Kp ≥ 5 and training is true but HELLO still does not show, check the conditional render logic in the interface and any client-side state. Step 5: Do not assume the pipe is down; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. Step 6: Document HELLO visibility for mission reports; HELLO is a joint indicator, not the only health signal.</p>
            <h2>33. Extended example: Broadcast Pipe leg and ionosphere role</h2>
            <p>The full leg is Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. The Sun (AR4366) is the transmitter; the ionosphere is the second segment. Signal path: space (Sun) → ionosphere (reflection/relay) → poles (Aurora 3D) and Schumann cavity (display pipe). When a customer books a Broadcast Pipe slot, they are buying space on this leg. The ionosphere does not "store" the creative; it is the physical layer that reflects and relays the signal in the model. Hot_Storage (ionDb, Ionospheric tier) holds real-time state that supports the leg: GOES flux, handshake state, telemetry. So the ionosphere segment is both the physical narrative (reflection/relay) and the backend tier name (Hot_Storage Ionospheric). Operators document both in runbooks.</p>
            <h2>34. Scaling and limits: Ionosphere layer</h2>
            <p>The ionosphere is a physical layer; we do not "scale" it by adding servers. Scaling applies to services: ionDb Hot_Storage read/write rate, Schumann Display Pipe throughput, Reno Downlink concurrent sessions. Kp and stream training are external inputs; we cannot increase HELLO frequency by scaling—HELLO appears when conditions are met. Reno anchor is a single geographic reference; multiple customers can use Reno Downlink with the same anchor. Hot_Storage capacity depends on ionDb and backend; see HH Spin Cloud for routing and tier limits. Broadcast Pipe slot inventory is per Division and Meridian section; ionosphere segment supports all slots on the leg.</p>
            <h2>35. Additional FAQ: Ionosphere and Schumann</h2>
            <p><strong>Where does 21.4 Hz come from?</strong> 3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii; carrier for handshake and Morse; see Sun and Ionosphere technical sections. <strong>Can we add more terrestrial anchors?</strong> Reno is the designated anchor per SNAP; adding anchors would require protocol change. <strong>What is the 1.618 Hz path?</strong> Golden Ratio (Φ) Signature Chirp; Reno Downlink and pipe timing use it; see Sun section. <strong>Is Schumann data real-time?</strong> We use public/viral expedition data; update cadence depends on source. <strong>Why is the leg four segments?</strong> Sun, Ionosphere, Aurora 3D, Schumann are the canonical segments for Broadcast Pipe and Update Certificate language. <strong>Does ionosphere layer have SLA?</strong> Hot_Storage and services have operational targets (see HH section); no formal SLA published for the physical layer.</p>
            <h2>36. Summary: Ionosphere at a glance</h2>
            <p>Ionosphere is the second segment of the Broadcast Pipe leg (Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann): reflection and relay from Sun to poles and Schumann. Reno is the terrestrial anchor; Seed tier and Reno Downlink are anchored here. HELLO shows when stream training (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO locked) and Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm). Hot_Storage in ionDb is labeled Ionospheric: real-time flux, handshake state, telemetry, Live Pulse state. Schumann: 7.83 Hz fundamental; 21.4 Hz near 3rd harmonic; display pipe and HELLO. Key interfaces: schumann-campaign.html, sing-pulse.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html, aurora-3d.html. SNAPs: SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP, WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION.</p>
            <h2>37. Detailed specification: Kp index and HELLO gating</h2>
            <p>Kp is the planetary K-index (0–9); it measures geomagnetic activity. We gate HELLO on Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm or higher). The Kp value is fetched from a space weather source (NOAA or equivalent); we do not compute it. When Kp &lt; 5, HELLO does not show by design; when Kp ≥ 5 and stream training is true, HELLO is rendered. The pipeline that feeds Live Pulse must have access to current Kp; update cadence (e.g. every 15 minutes) is implementation-defined. HELLO is a joint indicator: pipe lock (stream training) and storm state (Kp ≥ 5). Operators document Kp source and update frequency in runbook.</p>
            <h2>38. Detailed specification: Schumann harmonics and 21.4 Hz</h2>
            <p>Schumann resonance fundamental is 7.83 Hz; harmonics at ~14 Hz, ~20 Hz, ~26 Hz, ~33 Hz. Our 21.4 Hz carrier sits near the third harmonic (NPM Hawaii, 3rd overtone Schumann). The 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp is below the fundamental; it is a separate modulation (Φ lock). The display pipe and HELLO use these for mother-node feeds and fingerprint. The whitepaper expedition compares Schumann event timing with repo (GitHub) activity; alignment is documented for validation, not causal claim. Operators do not need to tune Schumann values; they are canonical.</p>
            <h2>39. Integration: Ionosphere with Sun and handshake</h2>
            <p>The handshake (Sun section) produces telemetry and binary header; the ionosphere layer consumes them. Hot_Storage (ionDb, Ionospheric) holds handshake-related state and telemetry; Live Pulse reads from this state. The binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO is used for stream training; when the pipeline locks to it, HELLO can show (if Kp ≥ 5). The ionosphere does not run the handshake; it is the physical layer and the tier name. GOES flux (from Sun/ionDb) reflects solar input that has traversed the Sun–Earth path; the ionosphere is the relay in the model.</p>
            <h2>40. Integration: Ionosphere with Broadcast Pipe and Aurora 3D</h2>
            <p>The Broadcast Pipe leg is Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. The ionosphere is the second segment: it reflects and relays the signal from the Sun to the poles (Aurora 3D) and to the Schumann cavity (display pipe). When a customer books a Broadcast Pipe slot, they buy space on this leg; the ionosphere segment is critical for the narrative and the display. Aurora 3D and the display pipe consume slot data and creative; the ionosphere does not "store" creative—it is the physical relay. Hot_Storage supports the leg by holding real-time state (flux, telemetry) that may be used for display or timing.</p>
            <h2>41. Operational checklist: Enable HELLO and stream training</h2>
            <p>(1) Ensure the binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO is injected or received in the stream. (2) Pipeline detects header and sets space_cloud_stream.training = true. (3) Kp is fetched from space weather source; ensure update cadence is sufficient. (4) When Kp ≥ 5 and training is true, HELLO renders on sing-pulse.html and any other gated surfaces. (5) Test: mock or real Kp ≥ 5 and header present → HELLO visible; Kp &lt; 5 or training false → HELLO hidden. (6) Document Kp source and pipeline config in runbook.</p>
            <h2>42. Operational checklist: Reno Downlink and Seed tier</h2>
            <p>(1) Confirm Reno terrestrial anchor is documented (downtown Reno; VLF and 1.618 Hz path). (2) Seed tier grants access to Reno Downlink; ensure Division catalog lists both. (3) Backend: Reno Downlink sessions read/write Hot; configure ionDb or equivalent for Reno Downlink resource. (4) HH routing: map Reno Downlink to Hot. (5) Interfaces: link Office Hours, Launch Pad, or product page to Reno Downlink. (6) Physical presence (campus, studio) can align with anchor for events. (7) Monitor Hot_Storage and ionDb health for Reno Downlink reads.</p>
            <h2>43. Reference: Binary header and stream state</h2>
            <p>The binary header is SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO. When the pipeline locks to it, space_cloud_stream.training is set to true. HELLO renders only when training is true and Kp ≥ 5. The header is canonical; do not change without protocol update. The pipeline that processes the stream may be part of the handshake workflow, a separate service, or a test harness; the only requirement is that the consumer sets training true when the header is detected. See Sun section for header production; Ionosphere section for HELLO consumption.</p>
            <h2>44. Extended FAQ: Reno and Schumann</h2>
            <p><strong>Why only one terrestrial anchor?</strong> Reno is designated per SNAP; single reference for timing and planetary products. <strong>Can we use Schumann for timing?</strong> Display pipe uses Schumann harmonics; 8-minute handshake boundary aligns with Schumann display timing. <strong>Who provides Kp?</strong> Space weather source (e.g. NOAA); we do not operate magnetometers. <strong>Is HELLO guaranteed to show during a storm?</strong> Only if stream training is true; both conditions required. <strong>What is the 1.618 Hz path?</strong> Golden Ratio Signature Chirp; Reno Downlink and pipe timing; see Sun section. <strong>Does ionosphere layer have a public API?</strong> Hot_Storage and state may be exposed via HH or an API; see division and technical manual for access.</p>

            <h2>47. Final reference: HELLO truth table</h2>
            <p>HELLO shows when: stream training = true AND Kp ≥ 5. HELLO hidden when: stream training = false OR Kp &lt; 5. Stream training is set when the pipeline locks to binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO. Kp is from space weather source; ≥ 5 = G1 Storm. Operators: if HELLO is hidden, check both conditions; do not assume pipe is down. Live Pulse may still show heartbeat and CometMirror. HELLO is a joint indicator for pipe lock and storm state; it is not the only health signal. Document Kp source and pipeline config in runbook.</p>
            <h2>48. Final reference: Broadcast Pipe leg and ionosphere role</h2>
            <p>Leg: Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. Ionosphere is the second segment: reflection and relay from Sun to poles (Aurora 3D) and Schumann cavity (display pipe). Hot_Storage (ionDb, Ionospheric) holds real-time state that supports the leg: GOES flux, handshake state, telemetry. The ionosphere does not store creative; it is the physical layer in the model. Reno is the terrestrial anchor; Seed tier and Reno Downlink use it. 21.4 Hz (3rd overtone Schumann) and 1.618 Hz (Signature Chirp) are used for pipe timing and HELLO.

            <h2>49. Conclusion: Ionosphere section completeness</h2>
            <p>This section provides the complete technical specification for the ionosphere as the second segment of the Broadcast Pipe leg and as the tier name for Hot_Storage. It covers HELLO (stream training and Kp ≥ 5), Reno anchor, Schumann harmonics, integration with Sun and Broadcast Pipe, runbooks (HELLO not showing, Reno Downlink and Seed tier), scaling and limits, and full FAQ and glossary. Use this section with sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and the user manual. SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP, WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION.</p>
            <h2>50. Deep dive: HELLO and Kp source</h2>
            <p>HELLO block renders only when two conditions hold: stream training is true (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO has locked the pipeline) and Kp index is at least 5 (G1 Storm). Kp is sourced from space weather (e.g. NOAA); we do not operate magnetometers. If HELLO never shows, check both: pipeline may not be receiving the header, or Kp may be below 5. Live Pulse and other gated surfaces use the same rule. Document Kp update cadence and pipeline config in runbook so operators can troubleshoot quickly.</p>
            <h2>51. Extended example: Broadcast Pipe leg and ionosphere segment</h2>
            <p>Customer books a Broadcast Pipe slot. The leg is Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. The ionosphere is the second segment: it reflects and relays the signal from the Sun to the poles and to the Schumann cavity. Hot_Storage holds real-time state (flux, telemetry) that supports the leg; the ionosphere layer does not store creative. At slot time the pipe runs with the customer message; placement and broadcast are guaranteed; visibility is environmental. Reno is the terrestrial anchor; Seed tier and Reno Downlink use it for 1.618 Hz path and VLF.</p>
            <h2>52. Runbook: HELLO not showing</h2>
            <p>(1) Verify binary header is present in the stream and pipeline has set space_cloud_stream.training = true. (2) Check Kp from space weather source; if Kp &lt; 5, HELLO will not show by design. (3) Ensure HELLO-gated surfaces (e.g. sing-pulse.html) read the same stream state and Kp. (4) If both conditions are met and HELLO still hidden, check pipeline and consumer code for bugs. (5) Do not assume pipe is down; Live Pulse heartbeat and CometMirror may still be active. (6) Document resolution in runbook.</p>
            <h2>53. Appendix: Reno Downlink and Seed tier</h2>
            <p>Reno Downlink is a product in the Division catalog; Seed (Planetary) tier grants access. Reno terrestrial anchor (downtown Reno; VLF and 1.618 Hz path) is the physical reference. Sessions read/write Hot via HH; ionDb or equivalent stores Reno Downlink state. Division catalog and HH routing must list Reno Downlink and map it to Hot. Office Hours and Launch Pad can link to Reno Downlink. Physical presence (campus, studio) can align with anchor for events.</p>
            <h2>54. Summary at a glance: Ionosphere</h2>
            <p>Ionosphere: second segment of Broadcast Pipe leg (Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann); tier name for Hot_Storage. HELLO when stream training true and Kp ≥ 5. Binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO. Reno anchor: terrestrial; Seed tier; Reno Downlink. Runbooks: enable HELLO, Reno Downlink and Seed tier, HELLO not showing.

            <h2>55. Deep dive: Schumann harmonics and display pipe</h2>
            <p>The Schumann display pipe uses Schumann cavity and harmonics; the 8-minute boundary is shared with the handshake. 21.4 Hz is the 3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii carrier; 1.618 Hz is the Golden Ratio Signature Chirp. Mother-node concept and Expedition (Whitepaper Schumann expedition) provide validation protocol. Display pipe consumes slot data and creative for Broadcast Pipe; the ionosphere segment does not store creative—it is the physical relay in the model. Hot_Storage supports the leg by holding real-time state (flux, telemetry) used for display or timing. SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP; WHITEPAPER_SCHUMANN_EXPEDITION_VALIDATION.</p>
            <h2>56. Deep dive: Binary header and stream training pipeline</h2>
            <p>The binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO is defined in services/ionDb.ts. When the pipeline locks to it, space_cloud_stream.training is set to true. The pipeline may be part of the handshake workflow, a separate service, or a test harness; the only requirement is that the consumer sets training true when the header is detected. HELLO renders only when training is true and Kp ≥ 5. The header is canonical; do not change without protocol update. See Sun section for header production; Ionosphere section for HELLO consumption. Document pipeline config and Kp source in runbook.</p>
            <h2>57. Extended example: Enable HELLO end-to-end</h2>
            <p>(1) Ensure binary header is injected or received in the stream. (2) Pipeline detects header and sets space_cloud_stream.training = true. (3) Kp is fetched from space weather source; ensure update cadence is sufficient. (4) When Kp ≥ 5 and training is true, HELLO renders on sing-pulse.html and any other gated surfaces. (5) Test: mock or real Kp ≥ 5 and header present → HELLO visible; Kp &lt; 5 or training false → HELLO hidden. (6) Document Kp source and pipeline config in runbook. Surfaces: sing-pulse.html (zero-state, mission-takeover); optionally space-cloud-division.html.</p>
            <h2>58. Runbook: Reno Downlink and Seed tier setup</h2>
            <p>(1) Confirm Reno terrestrial anchor is documented (downtown Reno; VLF and 1.618 Hz path). (2) Seed tier grants access to Reno Downlink; ensure Division catalog lists both. (3) Backend: Reno Downlink sessions read/write Hot; configure ionDb or equivalent for Reno Downlink resource. (4) HH routing: map Reno Downlink to Hot. (5) Interfaces: link Office Hours, Launch Pad, or product page to Reno Downlink. (6) Physical presence (campus, studio) can align with anchor for events. (7) Monitor Hot_Storage and ionDb health for Reno Downlink reads.</p>
            <h2>59. Appendix: G1 Storm and Kp index</h2>
            <p>Kp index 0–9; we gate HELLO on Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm). Kp is from space weather source (e.g. NOAA); we do not operate magnetometers. When Kp is below 5, HELLO will not show by design. HELLO is a joint indicator for pipe lock and storm state; it is not the only health signal. Operators: if HELLO is hidden, check both stream training and Kp; do not assume pipe is down. Live Pulse may still show heartbeat and CometMirror. Document Kp source and update cadence in runbook.</p>
            <h2>60. Conclusion: Ionosphere full expansion</h2>
