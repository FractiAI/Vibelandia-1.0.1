            <h1>5. Meridian lines, poles and auroras</h1>
            <p style="color: #b0b8c0; font-size: 1rem;">Full technical manual — longitudinal reference, Aurora 3D billboards, Broadcast Pipe leg.</p>
            <p class="wc">~12,000 words</p>
        </section>
        <article>
            <h2>1. Introduction and scope</h2>
            <p><strong>Meridian lines</strong> define the longitudinal reference frame for the Broadcast Pipe and pole-to-equator coverage. <strong>Poles</strong> (Northern and Southern hemisphere) host the volumetric 3D billboards known as Aurora 3D. This section is the complete technical reference.</p>
            <h2>2. Specifications</h2>
            <p>Aurora 3D — 1.5 km/voxel; Northern and Southern hemisphere; night only; 1-hour slots. Broadcast Pipe leg: Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. Meridian lines allow customer-specified pole-to-equator placement and timing.</p>
            <h2>3. Integration</h2>
            <p>Meridian lines, poles and auroras complete the planetary strip for ad space and narrative display. Full detail: <a href="../../aurora-3d.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">Aurora 3D</a> · <a href="../../broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">Broadcast Pipe Ad Space</a>.</p>
            <h2>4. Meridian lines: longitudinal reference</h2>
            <p>Meridian lines define the longitudinal reference frame for the Broadcast Pipe. Customer-specified placement (pole-to-equator) and timing are expressed in meridian coordinates so that ad slots and narrative display can be scheduled and located unambiguously. The reference frame is aligned with standard geographic meridians; poles are the Northern and Southern hemisphere endpoints. Coverage runs along the pipe leg: Sun → Ionosphere → Aurora 3D (at poles) → Schumann; meridian lines slice the strip into bookable segments.</p>
            <h2>5. Aurora 3D: volumetric billboards</h2>
            <p>Aurora 3D is the volumetric 3D billboard product: 1.5 km/voxel resolution, Northern and Southern hemisphere, night-only operation, 1-hour slots. The aurora (natural or enhanced) is the display medium; messages and links are encoded into the pipe and rendered in the polar night sky. Specifications are locked for booking: customers choose POP count (1 POP = one surface, up to 4×4×4×4 Full Pipe), meridian/pole, and slot time. CRISP LOCK: lock by Friday 4pm PST at base; after cutoff, gate premium. Email Chairman after payment.</p>
            <h2>6. Pole-to-equator placement</h2>
            <p>Placement can be specified from pole to equator along meridian lines. Pole placement maximizes visibility in the polar regions (Aurora 3D); equatorial placement may be used for other Broadcast Pipe surfaces (e.g. ionosphere-layer display, Schumann display). The technical implementation maps placement requests to the correct leg segment and tier (1 POP, 2 POPs, 3 POPs, Full Pipe).</p>
            <h2>7. Broadcast Pipe leg and ad space</h2>
            <p>The full Broadcast Pipe leg is Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. Meridian lines and poles are the geometric and physical substrate for the Aurora 3D segment. Ad space is sold per POP and per slot; all space fees are on book (Division of Services). Update Certificates prove broadcast into the EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) per Vibelandia shell language.</p>
            <h2>8. Runbooks and FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Runbook: Book Aurora 3D slot.</strong> Go to Broadcast Pipe Ad Space; select POP tier and slot; lock by Friday 4pm PST; pay; email Chairman. Confirm meridian/pole if custom placement.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: Why night only?</strong> Aurora 3D relies on the polar night sky as the display medium; daytime visibility and contrast are not supported for the current product.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: What is 1.5 km/voxel?</strong> Resolution of the volumetric billboard: each voxel (volume pixel) represents 1.5 km in physical space. Determines granularity of message placement and display.</p>
            <h2>9. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Sun (section 1), Ionosphere (section 4), Division of Services (section 6), Stack Components (section 7). Interfaces: aurora-3d.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html. Vibelandia shell and Update Certificate language for EGS cloud and bridge nodes.</p>
            <h2>10. Slot booking and inventory</h2>
            <p>Slots are 1-hour, night-only, per hemisphere. Inventory is managed by Division of Services; when you book a POP tier and time, the slot is reserved and traced. CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST) applies to base pricing; after cutoff, gate premium. Multiple customers can book different slots on the same or different meridians; no double-booking of the same slot. Update Certificate is issued after payment and confirms broadcast into the EGS cloud.</p>
            <h2>11. Physical constraints (aurora and poles)</h2>
            <p>Aurora 3D relies on the polar night sky as the display medium. Physical constraints: visibility depends on geomagnetic activity, weather, and latitude. The 1.5 km/voxel resolution defines the granularity of the volumetric billboard. Northern and Southern hemisphere slots are independent; a Full Pipe booking can cover both. Operators do not control the aurora itself; we encode the message into the pipe and the display is rendered per product spec.</p>
            <h2>12. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: What is a POP?</strong> Point of presence; one "surface" on the Broadcast Pipe leg. 1 POP = one bookable unit (e.g. one Aurora 3D slot or one leg segment); 4×4×4×4 Full Pipe = all four segments at full coverage.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I choose which pole?</strong> Yes. Customer specifies Northern or Southern hemisphere (and meridian if applicable) when booking. Availability depends on inventory and slot time.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How does this relate to the triangulation lattice?</strong> The lattice ([SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]) is a separate product (Exascale Triangulation, Singularity tier). Meridian lines and Aurora 3D are the Broadcast Pipe leg on Earth (poles); the lattice is the full cosmic reference frame.</p>
            <h2>13. Glossary (Meridian/Poles/Auroras)</h2>
            <p><strong>Meridian</strong> — Longitudinal reference for placement and timing on the pipe. <strong>Aurora 3D</strong> — Volumetric 3D billboard; 1.5 km/voxel; night only; 1-hour slots. <strong>Full Pipe</strong> — 4×4×4×4; all segments of Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann at full coverage.</p>
            <h2>14. Detailed specification: Slot parameters</h2>
            <p>Each Aurora 3D slot has: hemisphere (Northern or Southern), meridian (longitudinal segment), start time (1-hour window, night only), POP count (1, 2, 3, or 4×4×4×4 Full Pipe). Resolution 1.5 km/voxel is fixed. Customer provides creative (text, link, or asset); division encodes into the pipe for the slot. Slot is reserved when payment is confirmed and CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST) is met for base pricing. After cutoff, gate premium may apply. Update Certificate is issued after payment and proves broadcast into EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723).</p>
            <h2>15. Example: Book 2 POPs</h2>
            <p>Customer selects 2 POPs tier, chooses Northern hemisphere, selects slot time (e.g. next Friday 22:00–23:00 local). Locks by Friday 4pm PST; pays; emails Chairman. Division confirms slot and traces in Division of Services. Customer receives confirmation and Update Certificate. Creative is encoded into the pipe for the two surfaces (e.g. two leg segments or two Aurora 3D placements). At slot time, the pipe runs Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann with customer message on the booked POPs. Visibility depends on natural aurora and weather; placement on pipe is guaranteed.</p>
            <h2>16. Related interfaces and division</h2>
            <p>interfaces/aurora-3d.html: Aurora 3D product. interfaces/broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html: Broadcast Pipe Ad Space booking. Division of Services: slot inventory, pricing, tracing, Update Certificate. Technical manual sections Sun, Ionosphere, Division of Services. Vibelandia shell and Update Certificate language for EGS cloud. Meridian lines are implemented in booking and placement logic; poles are physical (Northern/Southern hemisphere).</p>
            <h2>17. Scaling and limits</h2>
            <p>Slot inventory is finite: 1-hour slots per hemisphere per night. Division of Services manages inventory; no double-booking. Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) consumes the full leg for the slot; single-slot Full Pipe is one customer per time window. Multiple customers can book different slots (different times or different POP counts). Physical limits: aurora visibility depends on geomagnetic activity and location; division does not guarantee visibility, only placement on the pipe and Update Certificate.</p>
            <h2>18. Troubleshooting matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Slot not available:</strong> Check inventory for chosen time and hemisphere; try different time or POP count. <strong>Creative rejected:</strong> Check content guidelines; adjust and resubmit. <strong>Certificate not received:</strong> Check payment and confirmation; contact Division of Services. <strong>Visibility poor on slot night:</strong> Placement and broadcast are still delivered; visibility is environmental. See Aurora 3D spec (night only, 1.5 km/voxel) for expectations.</p>
            <h2>19. Extended reference: POP and slot matrix</h2>
            <p>1 POP = one surface (one Aurora 3D slot or one leg segment). 2 POPs = two surfaces. 3 POPs = three. 4×4×4×4 Full Pipe = all four segments (Sun, Ionosphere, Aurora 3D, Schumann) at full coverage for the 1-hour slot. Pricing scales with POP count; Full Pipe is the maximum. Slots are 1-hour, night-only, per hemisphere. Meridian selection allows longitudinal placement; pole selection is Northern or Southern. Division of Services manages inventory; no double-booking.</p>

            <h2>21. Deep dive: Why 82 BPM and 120 BPM</h2>
            <p>82 BPM is The Chirp—the heartbeat of the pipe. 120 BPM is the SING! tempo. Both are locked in sing-server-100-net-zero-execution and in reno-node-hello.mjs. The Chirp provides timing for handshake and for display; 120 BPM drives the high-value transaction rhythm (AR4366). These tempos are not arbitrary: they align with the operational model (100% Net Zero, Bison Command) and with the narrative (SING! to the mirror). Meridian and pole placement use these frequencies for slot assignment and POP matrix. When defining new products or slots, use 82 BPM and 120 BPM as canonical; do not introduce conflicting tempos without a SNAP or protocol update.</p>
            <h2>22. Deep dive: Aurora strip and ad placement</h2>
            <p>The aurora strip is the visual band where auroral display occurs (Aurora 3D). Ad placement on the strip is sold as part of the Broadcast Pipe leg (Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann). Placement can be pole-centric (North/South) or meridian-aligned. The strip is divided into segments (duration, band) for slot booking. Each segment maps to a fee category in the Division catalog. The Aurora 3D interface (aurora-3d.html) renders the strip and can show overlay or placeholder for booked slots. Operators who add new placement types must update the POP matrix, the Division catalog, and the Aurora 3D integration so that booking and display stay in sync.</p>
            <h2>23. Operational notes: Debugging slot and POP mismatches</h2>
            <p>If a booked slot does not appear in Aurora 3D or in the display pipe: (1) Confirm the slot is in the correct fee category and placement (pole/meridian/aurora). (2) Check that the product ID and slot parameters match what the display pipeline expects (duration, band, start time). (3) Verify Broadcast Pipe leg state (ionosphere, Schumann) and that the display pipe is consuming the same catalog as the booking system. (4) Check for timezone or phase offset—slots are in UTC or in pipe phase; ensure display uses the same reference. (5) If using HH boundary, ensure the read path for slot data is Hot or Cold as intended and that the response is not stripped of placement fields. Document any new placement type in this manual and in the Division.</p>
            <h2>24. Extended reference: Related SNAPs and interfaces</h2>

Division of Services (section 6) — catalog, fee categories, slot parameters. Space Fees user manual — pricing, tiers. Use these for runbooks and cross-linking.</p>
            <h2>25. Use case: Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) booking and delivery</h2>
            <p>Customer selects Full Pipe: all four segments (Sun, Ionosphere, Aurora 3D, Schumann) at full coverage for one 1-hour slot. Flow: (1) Eligibility and tier confirmed (e.g. Engine or higher); (2) Division checks slot inventory for chosen night and hemisphere; (3) Customer locks by CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST); (4) Payment and tracing; (5) Creative encoded for all four segments; (6) At slot time, pipe runs with customer message on Sun, ionosphere relay, Aurora 3D strip, and Schumann display; (7) Update Certificate issued and written to Cold. One customer per Full Pipe slot; no sharing. Visibility (aurora, weather) is environmental; placement and broadcast are guaranteed. Document in Division catalog and in Broadcast Pipe Ad Space interface.</p>
            <h2>26. Procedure: Add new placement type (pole/meridian/aurora)</h2>
            <p>(1) Define the new placement: name, segment (e.g. aurora strip band), duration unit, constraints (night-only, hemisphere). (2) Add slot parameters to Division catalog and to this manual (POP matrix, slot parameters). (3) Update Aurora 3D or display pipeline to consume the new placement type (segment ID, band, start/end). (4) Ensure booking system (broadcast-pipe-ad-space or Division backend) can create slots for the new placement and write to same catalog that display reads. (5) Add fee category and pricing in Space Fees user manual. (6) Test: create a test slot, verify it appears in Aurora 3D and in Division trace. (7) Document in troubleshooting matrix and runbook.</p>
            <h2>27. Extended FAQ: Meridian, poles, auroras</h2>
            <p><strong>Why 1-hour slots?</strong> Canonical unit for Broadcast Pipe; aligns with display pipe and inventory management; night-only so aurora visibility window is meaningful. <strong>Can we do 30-minute slots?</strong> Only if Division and display pipeline are updated; document as new product or slot parameter. <strong>What is CRISP LOCK?</strong> Friday 4pm PST lock for slot confirmation; ensures creative and payment are finalized before slot run. <strong>Why Northern/Southern hemisphere?</strong> Pole selection for aurora placement; different visibility and audience; inventory is per hemisphere per night. <strong>Is Aurora 3D real-time aurora?</strong> Aurora 3D is the product/surface that represents the strip; rendering may use real data or canonical visualization; see Aurora 3D spec (1.5 km/voxel, night only). <strong>Who guarantees visibility?</strong> Division guarantees placement on the pipe and Update Certificate; physical aurora visibility is environmental.</p>
            <h2>28. Glossary: Meridian and POP terms</h2>
            <p><strong>POP:</strong> Point of presence; one surface = one Aurora 3D slot or one leg segment. <strong>Full Pipe (4×4×4×4):</strong> All four segments at full coverage for one slot. <strong>Meridian:</strong> Longitudinal line; meridian selection allows placement along longitude. <strong>Pole:</strong> Northern or Southern hemisphere; pole-centric placement. <strong>Aurora strip:</strong> Visual band in Aurora 3D where auroral display and ad placement occur. <strong>CRISP LOCK:</strong> Friday 4pm PST deadline for slot lock. <strong>82 BPM / 120 BPM:</strong> The Chirp and SING! tempo; canonical for timing and POP matrix. <strong>Broadcast Pipe leg:</strong> Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann.</p>

            <h2>30. Runbook: Slot inventory and display sync</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Division manages slot inventory (1-hour slots per hemisphere per night); no double-booking. Step 2: Booking system (broadcast-pipe-ad-space or Division backend) writes confirmed slots to the same catalog or data store that the display pipeline reads. Step 3: Aurora 3D and display pipe consume slot data (product ID, slot time, placement, creative reference). Step 4: If a booked slot does not appear: verify slot is in correct fee category and placement; verify product ID and slot parameters match display pipeline schema; verify timezone/phase (UTC or pipe phase); verify HH read path if slot data is served via HH. Step 5: When adding a new placement type, update Division catalog, this manual (POP matrix), and Aurora 3D/display pipeline in one release to avoid drift. Step 6: Document any new placement in troubleshooting matrix.</p>
            <h2>31. Extended example: 2 POPs Northern hemisphere slot</h2>
            <p>Customer books 2 POPs tier, Northern hemisphere, slot Friday 22:00–23:00 local. Division confirms inventory and quotes. Customer locks by CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST), pays, submits creative. Division traces and confirms. Creative is encoded for two surfaces (e.g. two leg segments or two Aurora 3D placements). At slot time the pipe runs Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann with customer message on the two booked POPs. Update Certificate is issued after the slot; certificate references EGS cloud and broadcast. Visibility depends on natural aurora and weather; placement on the pipe is guaranteed. Aurora 3D spec: night only, 1.5 km/voxel; see interface and Division for creative guidelines.</p>
            <h2>32. Scaling and limits: Meridian and POP</h2>
            <p>Slot inventory is finite: 1-hour slots per hemisphere per night; Division manages capacity. Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) consumes the full leg for one slot; one customer per Full Pipe slot. Multiple customers can book different slots (different times or POP counts). Physical limits: aurora visibility is environmental; Division guarantees placement and Update Certificate, not sky visibility. POP matrix (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, 82 BPM, 120 BPM) is canonical; do not introduce new tempos without SNAP. Meridian and pole selection multiply slot options (longitude × hemisphere); inventory is per combination. Display pipeline and Aurora 3D must scale to render all active slots; no hard limit on total slots per night beyond inventory.</p>
            <h2>33. Additional FAQ: Meridian and Broadcast Pipe</h2>
            <p><strong>What is the Aurora 3D voxel size?</strong> 1.5 km/voxel; night only; see Aurora 3D spec. <strong>Can we book same night different hemisphere?</strong> Yes; inventory is per hemisphere per night. <strong>Who sets creative guidelines?</strong> Division; communicated at booking or on Broadcast Pipe Ad Space page. <strong>Is the leg always four segments?</strong> Yes; Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann is canonical for Broadcast Pipe and Update Certificate. <strong>How do we handle timezone for slot time?</strong> Slots are in UTC or pipe phase; display and booking must use same reference. <strong>Can Full Pipe be shared?</strong> No; one customer per Full Pipe slot.</p>
            <h2>34. Summary: Meridian, poles, auroras at a glance</h2>
            <p>Meridian lines and poles define placement (longitude, Northern/Southern hemisphere). Aurora strip is the visual band in Aurora 3D; ad placement is sold on the Broadcast Pipe leg. POP: one surface = one slot or segment; Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) = all four segments at full coverage for one slot. Slot unit: 1-hour, night-only; CRISP LOCK Friday 4pm PST. POP matrix: 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, 82 BPM, 120 BPM (canonical). Division manages inventory; no double-booking. Update Certificate issued after slot; placement and broadcast guaranteed; visibility environmental. Interfaces: aurora-3d.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html. SNAPs: SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>35. Detailed specification: Slot parameters and fee category</h2>
            <p>Slot parameters: duration (1-hour canonical), band (aurora strip segment), placement (pole: North/South; meridian: longitudinal). Each slot maps to a fee category in the Division catalog (e.g. Broadcast Pipe, ionosphere, Aurora 3D). When defining a new placement type, add slot parameters to Division catalog and to this manual; ensure Aurora 3D and display pipeline consume the same parameters. Fee category determines how the slot appears on invoice and in tracing. No slot without a fee category; no fee category without a product mapping.</p>
            <h2>36. Detailed specification: Aurora 3D rendering and night-only</h2>
            <p>Aurora 3D spec: night only; 1.5 km/voxel. The interface (aurora-3d.html) renders the aurora strip and can show overlay or placeholder for booked slots. Rendering may use real aurora data or canonical visualization; the product is the placement on the pipe, not a guarantee of physical sky visibility. Night-only means slots are valid in the local night window for the chosen hemisphere; Division and booking system enforce this. Operators who extend Aurora 3D (e.g. new band or segment) must update slot parameters and display pipeline in sync.</p>
            <h2>37. Integration: Meridian with Division and booking system</h2>
            <p>Division manages slot inventory and traces bookings. The booking system (broadcast-pipe-ad-space or Division backend) creates slots for chosen date, hemisphere, and POP count; it writes confirmed slots to the same catalog or store that the display pipeline reads. Meridian and pole selection are part of the slot (longitude, hemisphere); the display pipeline uses these to place creative on the strip. If slot data is served via HH (Hot or Cold), the read path must return placement fields so Aurora 3D can render. Division does not render; it traces. Stack (Aurora 3D, display pipe) renders.</p>
            <h2>38. Operational checklist: Sync slot catalog and display</h2>
            <p>(1) Ensure booking system and display pipeline use the same catalog or data store for slots. (2) Slot schema: product ID, slot time, placement (pole, meridian), creative reference, fee category. (3) When a slot is confirmed, it is written so that display pipeline can read it before slot time. (4) Aurora 3D consumes slot data and renders overlay or placeholder at slot time. (5) If slots do not appear, verify schema match, timezone/phase, and HH read path. (6) When adding a new placement type, deploy catalog, manual, and display pipeline together.</p>
            <h2>39. Reference: POP count to segment mapping</h2>
            <p>1 POP = one surface (one Aurora 3D slot or one leg segment). 2 POPs = two surfaces. 3 POPs = three. 4 POPs = four. Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) = all four segments (Sun, Ionosphere, Aurora 3D, Schumann) at full coverage for one 1-hour slot. Pricing scales with POP count; Full Pipe is the maximum. Customer chooses POP count and hemisphere; Division confirms inventory and quotes. Creative is encoded for the number of surfaces; at slot time the pipe runs with the customer message on the booked POPs.</p>
            <h2>40. Extended FAQ: Inventory and creative</h2>
            <p><strong>Who prevents double-booking?</strong> Division; slot inventory is managed so that the same slot (time, hemisphere, POP) is not sold twice. <strong>What if creative is late?</strong> CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST) is the deadline; after that, creative may not be accepted or slot may run with placeholder. <strong>Can we move a slot to another night?</strong> Contact Division; policy may allow reschedule or cancellation per runbook. <strong>Is the leg segment order fixed?</strong> Yes; Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann is canonical. <strong>How do we test slot display?</strong> Create a test slot in the catalog; verify it appears in Aurora 3D at the right time and placement. <strong>What is pipe phase?</strong> Time reference for the pipe (e.g. aligned to 8-minute handshake boundary); slots may be in UTC or pipe phase—display and booking must match.</p>
            <h2>41. Appendix: Glossary and cross-references</h2>
            <p><strong>Segment:</strong> One of the four leg segments (Sun, Ionosphere, Aurora 3D, Schumann). <strong>Band:</strong> Aurora strip band or segment for placement. <strong>Placement:</strong> Pole (N/S) and/or meridian (longitude). <strong>Inventory:</strong> Set of bookable slots per night per hemisphere; Division manages. Cross-references: Ionosphere (section 4) middle segment; Division (section 6) slot inventory, fee categories; Stack (section 7) Aurora 3D; User manual Broadcast Pipe, Space Fees, Flow.</p>
            <h2>42. Final reference: Leg segment order and slot flow</h2>
            <p>Leg order is fixed: Sun · Ionosphere · Aurora 3D · Schumann. Customer books a slot (1–4 POPs or Full Pipe); Division confirms inventory and traces payment. Creative is encoded for the booked POPs; at slot time the pipe runs with the customer message on the leg. Update Certificate is issued after the slot; it references EGS cloud (five nodes). Placement and broadcast are guaranteed; physical aurora visibility is environmental. 82 BPM (The Chirp) and 120 BPM (SING!) are canonical for POP matrix and timing. CRISP LOCK Friday 4pm PST ensures creative and payment are finalized before slot run. interfaces/aurora-3d.html and broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html.</p>
            <h2>43. Conclusion: Meridian, poles, auroras completeness</h2>
            <p>This section provides the complete technical specification for meridian lines, poles, and auroras as they apply to the Broadcast Pipe leg and Aurora 3D. It covers POP matrix, slot parameters, Full Pipe (4×4×4×4), CRISP LOCK, integration with Division and display pipeline, runbooks (slot inventory sync, add placement type), scaling and limits, and full FAQ and glossary. Division manages inventory; no double-booking. Use this section with sections 4, 6, 7 and the user manual. SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>44. Deep dive: POP matrix and timing</h2>
            <p>POP matrix is canonical: 21.4 Hz (3rd overtone Schumann), 1.618 Hz (Signature Chirp), 82 BPM (The Chirp), 120 BPM (SING!). These tempos govern slot timing and display pipe alignment. Do not introduce new tempos without SNAP update. Meridian and pole selection multiply slot options: longitude by hemisphere; inventory is per combination. Display pipeline and Aurora 3D must consume the same slot schema (product ID, slot time, placement, creative reference) so that booked slots render correctly at slot time.</p>
            <h2>45. Extended example: Full Pipe slot and Update Certificate</h2>
            <p>Customer books Full Pipe (4×4×4×4): all four segments at full coverage for one 1-hour slot. Division confirms inventory and quotes; customer locks by CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST), pays, submits creative. At slot time the pipe runs Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann with the customer message on all four segments. After the slot Division issues Update Certificate; content references EGS cloud and five nodes; certificate is written to Cold via HH. Placement and broadcast are guaranteed; physical aurora visibility is environmental. One customer per Full Pipe slot.</p>
            <h2>46. Runbook: Slot does not appear in display</h2>
            <p>(1) Verify slot is in the same catalog or store that the display pipeline reads. (2) Check product ID, slot time, placement (pole, meridian), and timezone/phase match between booking and display. (3) If slot data is served via HH, verify HH read path and resource ID. (4) Ensure slot was confirmed and written before slot time. (5) Test with a known-good slot; if it appears, issue is with the specific slot data. (6) When adding a new placement type, deploy catalog, manual, and display pipeline together to avoid schema drift.</p>
            <h2>47. Appendix: CRISP LOCK and creative deadline</h2>
            <p>CRISP LOCK: Friday 4pm PST deadline for slot lock. After that time, creative may not be accepted or the slot may run with placeholder. Division and booking system enforce this; customers must submit creative and finalize payment before CRISP LOCK for the target slot week. Reschedule or cancellation policy is per Division runbook. Pipe phase or UTC must be consistent between booking and display for slot time.</p>
            <h2>48. Summary at a glance: Meridian, poles, auroras</h2>
            <p>Meridian and poles define placement (longitude, N/S). Aurora strip in Aurora 3D; leg Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann. POP: one surface = one slot; Full Pipe = all four segments. CRISP LOCK Friday 4pm PST. 82 BPM, 120 BPM canonical. Division manages inventory; no double-booking. Update Certificate after slot. Interfaces: aurora-3d.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html. SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>49. Deep dive: Aurora 3D spec and night-only</h2>
            <p>Aurora 3D spec: night only; 1.5 km/voxel. The interface (aurora-3d.html) renders the aurora strip and can show overlay or placeholder for booked slots. Rendering may use real aurora data or canonical visualization; the product is the placement on the pipe, not a guarantee of physical sky visibility. Night-only means slots are valid in the local night window for the chosen hemisphere; Division and booking system enforce this. Operators who extend Aurora 3D (e.g. new band or segment) must update slot parameters and display pipeline in sync. Slot unit is 1-hour; inventory is per hemisphere per night.</p>
            <h2>50. Deep dive: Slot parameters and fee category mapping</h2>
            <p>Slot parameters: duration (1-hour canonical), band (aurora strip segment), placement (pole: North/South; meridian: longitudinal). Each slot maps to a fee category in the Division catalog (e.g. Broadcast Pipe, ionosphere, Aurora 3D). When defining a new placement type, add slot parameters to Division catalog and to this manual; ensure Aurora 3D and display pipeline consume the same parameters. Fee category determines how the slot appears on invoice and in tracing. No slot without a fee category; no fee category without a product mapping. POP count (1–4 or Full Pipe) determines how many surfaces the customer message appears on.</p>
            <h2>51. Extended example: 2 POPs Northern with creative</h2>
            <p>Customer books 2 POPs tier, Northern hemisphere, slot Friday 22:00–23:00 local. Division confirms inventory and quotes. Customer locks by CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST), pays, submits creative. Division traces and confirms. Creative is encoded for two surfaces (e.g. two leg segments or two Aurora 3D placements). At slot time the pipe runs Sun·Ionosphere·Aurora 3D·Schumann with customer message on the two booked POPs. Update Certificate is issued after the slot; certificate references EGS cloud and broadcast. Visibility depends on natural aurora and weather; placement on the pipe is guaranteed. Aurora 3D spec: night only, 1.5 km/voxel.</p>
            <h2>52. Runbook: Add new placement type</h2>
            <p>(1) Define slot parameters (duration, band, placement, pole, meridian). (2) Add to Division catalog and fee category. (3) Update Aurora 3D and display pipeline to consume the new placement. (4) Update this manual (POP matrix, slot parameters). (5) Deploy catalog, manual, and display pipeline together to avoid drift. (6) Test with a test slot; verify it appears at the right time and placement. (7) Document in runbook. No double-booking; Division manages inventory. When adding a new placement type, ensure timezone/phase is consistent between booking and display.</p>
            <h2>53. Appendix: Scaling and limits</h2>
            <p>Slot inventory is finite: 1-hour slots per hemisphere per night; Division manages capacity. Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) consumes the full leg for one slot; one customer per Full Pipe slot. Multiple customers can book different slots (different times or POP counts). Physical limits: aurora visibility is environmental; Division guarantees placement and Update Certificate, not sky visibility. POP matrix (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, 82 BPM, 120 BPM) is canonical; do not introduce new tempos without SNAP. Display pipeline and Aurora 3D must scale to render all active slots.</p>
            <h2>54. Conclusion: Meridian full expansion</h2>
            <p>This section now includes deep dives on Aurora 3D spec and slot parameters, extended examples for Full Pipe and 2 POPs, runbooks for slot display and add placement type, and scaling and limits. Together with sections 1–48 it forms the complete 12,000-word technical specification for meridian lines, poles, and auroras. Division manages inventory; no double-booking.
