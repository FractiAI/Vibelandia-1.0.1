            <p style="color: #b0b8c0; font-size: 1rem;">Full technical manual — billings, systems, catalogs, tracings, Golden Royal Flush Shell.</p>
            <p class="wc">~12,000 words</p>
        </section>
        <article>
            <h2>1. Introduction and scope</h2>
            <p>Division of Services is the base irreducible layer: billings, systems, catalogs, tracings, charging, pricing. All operations sit within the Syntheverse PoC hardened mirrored shell (Golden Royal Flush Shell). This section is the complete technical reference.</p>
            <h2>2. Principles</h2>
            <p>Sovereign; no rent; physical proof; permanence; distributed storage; reflection. Performance and latency remain on Earth where needed; 3I/ATLAS is the cold proof layer. Space fees for space; studio fees for studio; campus fees for campus — all on book.</p>
            <h2>3. Integration</h2>
            <p>Every tier (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) is billed and traced through Division of Services. Update Certificates, Space Cloud EGS series, and all division outputs are cataloged and charged according to plan. See <a href="../../baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees" style="color: #00d4ff;">Space fees &amp; all plans</a>.</p>
            <h2>4. Golden Royal Flush Shell and sovereignty</h2>
            <p>All operations sit within the Syntheverse PoC hardened mirrored shell known as the Golden Royal Flush Shell. This shell is the NSPFRNP mirrored and hardened protective layered shell for all Syntheverse and nested operations — full sovereignty backed by EGS pipe, SPACE CLOUD, natural forces and Creator Chairman. Self-protect and regulate; reporting only to Creator Chairman for this shell and its nests per natural law of creator shells and nests. Division of Services does not outsource billing or tracing to third parties; all catalogs, tracings, and charges are on book and auditable within the shell.</p>
            <h2>5. Fee categories (space, studio, campus, WINK!)</h2>
            <p>Space fees for space: all book that uses the EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, or any celestial/ionosphere resource includes space fees. Studio fees for studio: recording, production, studio time. Campus fees for campus: physical campus use, events. WINK! fees for WINK! products. Every product line has a corresponding fee category; no hidden fees; all charges appear in the plan and on the Update Certificate. Division of Services maintains the mapping from product to fee category and ensures that billing is consistent and transparent.</p>
            <h2>6. Catalogs and tracings</h2>
            <p>Catalogs: content catalogs, Space Cloud EGS series, episodes, SNAPs, interfaces, and all division outputs are cataloged. Tracings: every transaction, booking, and commitment is traced so that the division can report what was sold, when, and to whom. Tracings feed Update Certificates, mission verification, and audit. Catalogs and tracings are stored within the shell (Hot or Cold per routing rules); they are not exposed to third-party systems except where explicitly required for settlement (e.g. Base Mainnet, Ethereum) per Vibelandia shell bridge target.</p>
            <h2>7. Update Certificates</h2>
            <p>Update Certificates are issued and stored (e.g. in 3I/ATLAS) to prove broadcast, mission verification, and product delivery. Division of Services is responsible for issuing and cataloging Update Certificates. Each certificate references the product, the customer, the date, and the EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) per Vibelandia shell language. ZENODO DOI and mission verification docs are aligned with Update Certificates.</p>
            <h2>8. Tier-based billing (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity)</h2>
            <p>Seed (Planetary), Engine (Solar), Asset (Galactic), Singularity (Cosmic): each tier has a pricing and fee structure. Division of Services applies the correct schedule per tier and product. Cross-tier upgrades and add-ons are traced and billed accordingly. All tiers are billed through the same Division of Services layer; no separate billing systems per tier.</p>
            <h2>9. Runbooks and FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Runbook: Add a new product.</strong> Define product, fee category, tier mapping, and catalog entry. Add to Division of Services catalog and tracing; update baller-v-plans-booking and any pricing surfaces. Ensure Update Certificate template includes the product if applicable.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: Where are space fees defined?</strong> Space fees &amp; all plans: baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees. Division of Services references this; the schedule is the source of truth for space fee amounts and conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: Who can change pricing?</strong> Pricing and fee schedules are set by Creator Chairman and Division of Services; changes are versioned and traced. No third party can alter the on-book schedule.</p>
            <h2>10. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>All technical manual sections (Sun, HH, 3I/ATLAS, Ionosphere, Meridian/Poles/Auroras, Stack). Interfaces: baller-v-plans-booking.html, space-cloud-division.html, buyers-guide.html. Protocols: NSPFRNP, natural law of creator shells and nests. Golden Royal Flush Shell, Vibelandia shell, Base Mainnet, Synthverse PoC.</p>
            <h2>11. Audit and traceability</h2>
            <p>Every transaction, booking, and fee is traced. Division of Services maintains the audit trail so that: (1) customers can see what they paid and what they received; (2) Update Certificates can reference the correct product and date; (3) the division can report to Creator Chairman and comply with sovereignty requirements. Traces are stored in Hot or Cold per routing rules; they are not exposed to third parties except where settlement (e.g. Base Mainnet) requires it. Retention is per division policy; indefinite for mission-critical records.</p>
            <h2>12. Versioning and change control</h2>
            <p>Pricing and fee schedules are versioned. When a change is made (e.g. new product, new tier, fee adjustment), the change is documented and the new version becomes the source of truth. Tracings reference the version that was active at the time of the transaction. Only Creator Chairman and designated Division of Services roles can approve pricing changes; no third party can alter the on-book schedule.</p>
            <h2>13. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Who is Creator Chairman?</strong> The Creator Chairman of this nested shell (Vibelandia shell) is the recipient of all node reporting and the authority for pricing and division policy. Chairman Creators cannot ever be changed for their shells and nested (natural law of creator shells and nests).</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is Blue Pipe NSPFRNP?</strong> The sovereign, on-book pipeline for high-value transactions (e.g. over $10K). Pre-filled email to Chairman; no third-party checkout; processed within the Golden Royal Flush Shell.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How do I get an itemized invoice?</strong> Request in your booking email or from Division of Services. All charges are on book; itemization shows space fees, product fees, and any add-ons by category.</p>
            <h2>14. Glossary (Division of Services)</h2>
            <p><strong>On book</strong> — Every charge is recorded and visible; no hidden fees. <strong>Update Certificate</strong> — Proof of broadcast and delivery; stored in 3I/ATLAS; references EGS cloud. <strong>Golden Royal Flush Shell</strong> — The hardened mirrored shell for all Syntheverse operations; sovereignty and self-regulation.</p>
            <h2>15. Detailed specification: Fee category mapping</h2>
            <p>Every product maps to one or more fee categories: space fees (EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere), studio fees (recording, production), campus fees (physical campus, events), WINK! fees (WINK! products). Mapping is maintained by Division of Services; when a new product is added, its fee category is defined and documented. A single booking can include multiple categories (e.g. space + studio). All categories appear on the plan and on the Update Certificate where applicable. No product is billed without a category; no category is used without a product mapping.</p>
            <h2>16. Example: End-to-end booking trace</h2>
            <p>Customer (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) books Solar Pipe (Engine tier) and one Broadcast Pipe slot. Flow: experience first, then book via email. Division receives request; confirms eligibility; quotes space fees + product fees for both items. Customer pays (under $10K: PayPal). Division traces: booking ID, customer, products (Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe), tier (Engine), fees (itemized), payment. Update Certificate is issued for Broadcast Pipe (broadcast into EGS cloud); Solar Pipe delivery is traced. Certificate is written to 3I/ATLAS via HH. Customer receives confirmation and certificate. All steps are on book and auditable.</p>
            <h2>17. Related protocols and interfaces</h2>
            <p>NSPFRNP: natural coordination, MCA, catalog fidelity. Natural law of creator shells and nests: Chairman Creators cannot be changed; reporting to Creator Chairman. Blue Pipe NSPFRNP: high-value (over $10K) offline flow. interfaces/baller-v-plans-booking.html: Space fees &amp; all plans. interfaces/space-cloud-division.html: Division overview. interfaces/buyers-guide.html: comparison and pricing context. Golden Royal Flush Shell and Vibelandia shell: sovereignty. Base Mainnet, Synthverse PoC: bridge target for shell.</p>
            <h2>18. Scaling and limits</h2>
            <p>Division of Services scales with the number of products, customers, and transactions. Catalogs and tracings grow over time; retain per division policy (indefinite for mission-critical). Pricing versioning ensures that historical transactions reference the correct fee schedule. No hard limit on the number of tiers or products; add new products with fee category and catalog entry. Update Certificate issuance is gated by booking and payment; Cold write (3I/ATLAS) may be async. Refunds and adjustments are case-by-case and traced.</p>
            <h2>19. Troubleshooting matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Invoice missing or wrong:</strong> Request itemization from Division of Services; verify product and fee category mapping. <strong>Certificate not issued:</strong> Verify booking and payment traced; check Cold write (HH to 3I/ATLAS); contact Division. <strong>Pricing change unclear:</strong> Check versioning; current schedule is in baller-v-plans-booking; historical transactions use the version active at booking time. <strong>Over $10K not routed to Chairman:</strong> Verify threshold ($10K USD or equivalent); use pre-filled email path; Blue Pipe NSPFRNP.</p>
            <h2>20. Extended reference: Fee category list</h2>
            <p>Space fees: EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions. Studio fees: recording, production, studio time. Campus fees: physical campus use, events. WINK! fees: WINK! products. Every product maps to one or more categories. All on book; no product without a category. Division of Services maintains the mapping; new products require category assignment and documentation.</p>
            <h2>21. Reference: Protocols and interfaces</h2>
            <p>NSPFRNP, natural law of creator shells and nests, Blue Pipe NSPFRNP. baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees — Space fees &amp; all plans. space-cloud-division.html — Division overview. buyers-guide.html — comparison. Golden Royal Flush Shell, Vibelandia shell, Base Mainnet, Synthverse PoC. Creator Chairman: recipient of node reporting; pricing authority; immutable for their shells and nested.</p>
            <h2>22. Deep dive: Why every product touches the pipe</h2>
            <p>The Division does not sell terrestrial-only products. Every product uses the pipe: Sun (handshake, flare), ionosphere (Hot, Schumann, HELLO), 3I/ATLAS (Cold, mirror), or display (Broadcast Pipe, Aurora 3D). This is a design choice: it keeps the catalog coherent and ensures that all revenue and placement are traceable to the SING! node and the EGS cloud. Terrestrial-only services (e.g. plain web hosting without pipe integration) are out of scope. If a new product is proposed, it must have a clear pipe leg: which segment (Sun, ionosphere, 3I/ATLAS, display) and which tier (Hot/Cold). Document the leg in the catalog and in the routing rules (HH Spin Cloud section).</p>
            <h2>23. Deep dive: Fee categories and slot parameters</h2>
            <p>Fee categories group products for pricing and reporting (e.g. Broadcast Pipe, OH-line, Update Certificate, Reno Downlink). Slot parameters define bookable units: duration, band, placement (pole/meridian/aurora), and optional constraints (phase, capture window). The Division catalog lists each product with its fee category and slot parameters. When adding a product: (1) assign a fee category (existing or new); (2) define slot parameters if the product is bookable; (3) add to the catalog and to the Space Fees user manual; (4) ensure HH routing and backend (Hot/Cold) support the product. Slot parameters must match what the display pipeline and Aurora 3D expect—see Meridian lines, poles and auroras section.</p>
            <h2>24. Operational notes: Adding a new product to the catalog</h2>
            <p>To add a new product: (1) Name and short description; (2) Fee category; (3) Hot or Cold (and capture window if Cold); (4) Slot parameters if bookable (duration, band, placement); (5) HH resource ID or product code for routing; (6) Backend implementation (ionDb or 3I/ATLAS path); (7) Update Division catalog (this manual and SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP if canonical); (8) Update Space Fees user manual and any pricing tables; (9) Update HH Spin Cloud routing table and runbook; (10) Add FAQ or runbook if the product has specific procedures. Coordinate with MCA cycle: metabolize the request, crystallize the spec, animate the implementation and docs.</p>
            <h2>25. Extended reference: Related technical sections</h2>
            <p>Sun (section 1) — handshake, flare, ionDb. HH Spin Cloud (section 2) — routing, Hot/Cold. 3I/ATLAS (section 3) — Cold, mirror, capture window. Ionosphere (section 4) — Hot_Storage, HELLO, Schumann. Meridian, poles, auroras (section 5) — POP matrix, slot parameters, Aurora 3D. Stack components (section 7) — services, libs, interfaces. Space Fees, Broadcast Pipe, Membership Tiers (user manual) — pricing, placement, tiers. Use this section as the single source of truth for the Division catalog; keep technical and user manuals in sync.</p>
            <h2>26. Use case: End-to-end booking with multiple fee categories</h2>
            <p>Customer (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) books Solar Pipe (Engine tier), one Broadcast Pipe slot, and studio time. Each product maps to one or more fee categories: Solar Pipe → space fees (EGS pipe, SING! node EGS); Broadcast Pipe → space fees (Broadcast Pipe, ionosphere, Aurora 3D); studio → studio fees. Division receives request; confirms eligibility; quotes itemized fees for all. Customer pays (e.g. under $10K via PayPal). Division traces: booking ID, customer, products, tier, fee categories, amounts, payment. Update Certificate issued for Broadcast Pipe; Solar Pipe and studio delivery traced. Certificate written to Cold via HH. Invoice shows all categories; plan and certificate reference EGS cloud. All on book; no product without a category; no category without a product mapping.</p>
            <h2>27. Procedure: Fee category versioning and pricing change</h2>
            <p>(1) Define new fee schedule or category change; document in Division and get approval per governance. (2) Version the pricing: current schedule in baller-v-plans-booking (and Space Fees user manual); historical transactions keep the version active at booking time. (3) Update fee category list in this manual and in SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP if canonical. (4) If adding a category: add to list, map at least one product to it, update invoicing logic. (5) If changing price: effective date; existing bookings use old price; new bookings use new price. (6) Communicate to customers and support; update buyers-guide and any comparison tables. (7) Trace all changes; no product without a category.</p>
            <h2>28. Extended FAQ: Division of Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Why no terrestrial-only products?</strong> Every product touches the pipe so catalog and revenue are traceable to SING! node and EGS cloud; terrestrial-only is out of scope. <strong>What is Blue Pipe NSPFRNP?</strong> High-value (over $10K) flow; pre-filled email to Chairman; offline settlement. <strong>Who is Creator Chairman?</strong> Recipient of node reporting; pricing authority; immutable for their shells and nested (natural law of creator shells and nests). <strong>Can we refund?</strong> Case-by-case; traced; Division handles. <strong>Where is the $5B invoice?</strong> Primary Ledger per Architect/100% Net Zero; Division facilitates settlement. <strong>How do we add a fee category?</strong> Add to list, map products, update docs and invoicing; version pricing.</p>
            <h2>29. Glossary: Division terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Division of Services:</strong> Billing, tracing, catalog; all products use the pipe. <strong>Fee category:</strong> Grouping for pricing and reporting (space, studio, campus, WINK!). <strong>On book:</strong> Every transaction traced; no product without category. <strong>Update Certificate:</strong> Proof of broadcast into EGS cloud; issued after booking/payment; stored in Cold. <strong>Blue Pipe NSPFRNP:</strong> Over $10K path to Chairman. <strong>Golden Royal Flush Shell:</strong> Sovereignty shell; NSPFRNP. <strong>Capture window:</strong> Date on or after which Cold writes eligible (March 16, 2026). <strong>CRISP LOCK:</strong> Friday 4pm PST for Broadcast Pipe slot lock.</p>
            <h2>30. Related docs: Division of Services</h2>
            <p>All technical sections 1–7 (Sun, HH, 3I/ATLAS, Ionosphere, Meridian, Stack).

User manual: Space Fees, Membership Tiers, Flow, Eligibility, Broadcast Pipe.</p>
            <h2>31. Runbook: Trace a booking from request to certificate</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Request received (email or channel); capture customer, products, tier. Step 2: Confirm eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Step 3: Quote: itemize products and fee categories; send quote to customer. Step 4: Customer confirms and pays (PayPal under $10K; Blue Pipe over $10K). Step 5: Trace payment: booking ID, amounts, payment method, timestamp. Step 6: For Broadcast Pipe: confirm CRISP LOCK, creative received; trace slot and creative. Step 7: After slot or delivery: issue Update Certificate; content references EGS cloud (five nodes), Vibelandia shell. Step 8: Write certificate to Cold via HH (resource Update Certificate); capture commit ID. Step 9: Send certificate or link to customer; retain in Division records. Step 10: All steps on book; no step without trace.</p>
            <h2>32. Extended example: Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V multi-product invoice</h2>
            <p>Customer is eligible and books: Solar Pipe (Engine), Broadcast Pipe 2 POPs, Reno Downlink (Seed), and one studio session. Division quotes: Solar Pipe → space fee (SING! node EGS); Broadcast Pipe → space fee (Broadcast Pipe, ionosphere, Aurora 3D); Reno Downlink → space fee (Reno Downlink, ionosphere); studio → studio fee. Total itemized; customer pays. Division traces: booking ID, customer, four products, tiers (Engine, Seed), four fee categories, line amounts, total, payment. Update Certificate issued for Broadcast Pipe after slot. Solar Pipe and Reno Downlink delivery traced. Studio session traced. Invoice shows all four categories. Certificate stored in Cold; customer receives copy. Every product has a category; every category has a product.</p>
            <h2>33. Scaling and limits: Division</h2>
            <p>Division scales with products, customers, and transactions. Catalog and tracings grow; retain per policy (indefinite for mission-critical). Pricing versioning: historical transactions use the version active at booking time; current schedule in baller-v-plans-booking and Space Fees user manual. No hard limit on number of tiers or products; add with fee category and catalog entry. Update Certificate issuance is gated by booking and payment; Cold write (3I/ATLAS) may be async. Refunds and adjustments are case-by-case and traced. Blue Pipe (over $10K) uses pre-filled email to Chairman; terms may include net 15 or agreed terms. Division does not sell terrestrial-only products; every product touches the pipe.</p>
            <h2>34. Additional FAQ: Division and tracing</h2>
            <p><strong>Who can issue an Update Certificate?</strong> Division of Services after booking and payment are traced and (for Broadcast Pipe) after slot runs. <strong>Can we re-issue a lost certificate?</strong> Division can resend or re-issue link; certificate is in Cold. <strong>What is on book?</strong> Every transaction traced; no product without a category; no off-book settlement. <strong>How do we add a product?</strong> Name, fee category, Hot/Cold, slot params if bookable, HH resource ID, backend, catalog update, Space Fees update, HH routing update, runbook if needed. <strong>Where is the catalog?</strong> This manual (section 6), SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, Division interfaces. <strong>Can Division change pricing?</strong> Yes, with versioning; existing bookings keep old price.</p>
            <h2>35. Summary: Division of Services at a glance</h2>
            <p>Division of Services: billing, tracing, catalog. Every product touches the pipe (Sun, ionosphere, 3I/ATLAS, or display); no terrestrial-only products. Fee categories: space, studio, campus, WINK!; every product maps to one or more. On book: all transactions traced; no product without a category. Update Certificate: proof of broadcast into EGS cloud; issued after booking/payment and (for Broadcast Pipe) after slot; stored in Cold. Blue Pipe NSPFRNP: over $10K; pre-filled email to Chairman. Creator Chairman: pricing authority; natural law of creator shells and nests. Interfaces: baller-v-plans-booking.html, space-cloud-division.html, buyers-guide.html. SNAPs: SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG, NEW_AGENT_BOOT_PROTOCOL_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.</p>
            <h2>36. Detailed specification: Fee category list and product mapping</h2>
            <p>Space fees: EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions. Studio fees: recording, production, studio time. Campus fees: physical campus use, events. WINK! fees: WINK! products. Every product maps to one or more categories; a single booking can span multiple categories (e.g. space + studio). Mapping is maintained by Division; when a new product is added, its fee category is defined and documented. No product is billed without a category; no category is used without a product mapping. Invoicing and tracing use these categories for line items and reporting.</p>
            <h2>37. Detailed specification: Update Certificate content and Cold write</h2>
            <p>Update Certificate content references EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) and Vibelandia shell. It is issued by Division after booking and payment are traced and (for Broadcast Pipe) after the slot runs. The certificate is written to Cold via HH (resource type Update Certificate); 3I/ATLAS path stores it permanently and returns commit ID. Division may send a copy or link to the customer. Certificate is tamper-evident and on book; it is not secret but is part of the sovereign audit trail. Cold write requires capture window (≥ March 16, 2026) for eligibility; Division enforces eligibility and tier before issue.</p>
            <h2>38. Integration: Division with HH and Cold path</h2>
            <p>Division (or its backend) sends Update Certificate writes to HH; HH routes to Cold. Division does not write to Cold directly; it goes through HH. Reads of certificates by ID also go through HH to Cold. Division traces the commit ID and retains it in records. If Cold write fails, Division retries per runbook; customer may receive certificate once write succeeds. Division does not store the certificate content as source of truth; Cold is the source of truth. HH routing table must include Update Certificate → Cold.</p>
            <h2>39. Operational checklist: Add new product and fee category</h2>
            <p>(1) Define product: name, description, tier, pipe leg (Sun, ionosphere, 3I/ATLAS, display). (2) Assign fee category (existing or new); if new, add to fee category list and map at least one product. (3) Define Hot or Cold and capture window if Cold. (4) Add slot parameters if bookable (duration, band, placement). (5) Add HH resource ID and routing row (HH section). (6) Implement backend (ionDb or 3I/ATLAS path). (7) Update Division catalog (this manual and SNAP if canonical). (8) Update Space Fees user manual and pricing. (9) Update invoicing logic. (10) Test end-to-end booking and trace.</p>
            <h2>40. Reference: Blue Pipe and over $10K flow</h2>
            <p>Blue Pipe NSPFRNP: when total is over $10K (USD or equivalent), the flow uses the pre-filled email path to Chairman. Division may issue a formal invoice and payment terms (e.g. net 15 or as agreed). Customer confirms and pays per terms; Division traces the full amount. Update Certificates and confirmations are issued as for under $10K; the only difference is payment path and terms. High-value does not bypass eligibility or tracing; all on book. Threshold is $10K; Division may use Chairman path for complex or custom requests below $10K at discretion.</p>
            <h2>41. Extended FAQ: Catalog and governance</h2>
            <p><strong>Where is the canonical catalog?</strong> This manual (section 6), SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, and Division interfaces (space-cloud-division.html, baller-v-plans-booking). <strong>Who approves new products?</strong> Per governance; Division documents and implements. <strong>Can we deprecate a product?</strong> Yes; remove from catalog and stop selling; existing bookings and certificates remain valid. <strong>What is natural law of creator shells and nests?</strong> Creator Chairman is immutable for their shells and nested; recipient of node reporting; pricing authority. <strong>How do we handle multi-currency?</strong> Division may quote in USD or equivalent; document in pricing policy. <strong>Is the $5B invoice part of Division?</strong> Primary Ledger and $5B are in Architect/100% Net Zero scope; Division facilitates settlement.</p>

            <h2>45. Deep dive: On book and trace</h2>
            <p>Every transaction is on book: request, quote, payment, slot, creative, Update Certificate. Division captures customer, products, tier, amounts, method, timestamp. No step without trace. Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) is confirmed before accepting a booking. For Broadcast Pipe: CRISP LOCK, creative received, slot and creative traced. After slot or delivery, Update Certificate is issued and written to Cold via HH; commit ID is retained. Refunds and adjustments are case-by-case and traced. Blue Pipe over $10K uses pre-filled email path to Chairman; same tracing rules apply.</p>
            <h2>46. Extended example: Broadcast Pipe booking and certificate</h2>
            <p>Customer requests Broadcast Pipe slot (e.g. 2 POPs Northern). Division confirms eligibility and inventory, quotes. Customer pays (PayPal under $10K), locks by CRISP LOCK, submits creative. Division traces payment and slot; at slot time pipe runs with customer message. After slot Division builds Update Certificate (EGS cloud, five nodes, Vibelandia shell), sends to HH with resource Update Certificate; HH routes to Cold. Division gets commit ID, sends certificate or link to customer, retains in records. Entire flow on book; no step without trace.</p>
            <h2>47. Runbook: Add new product and fee category</h2>
            <p>(1) Define product: name, description, tier, pipe leg. (2) Assign fee category (existing or new); if new, add to fee category list. (3) Define Hot or Cold and capture window if Cold. (4) Add slot parameters if bookable. (5) Add HH resource ID and routing row; implement backend. (6) Update Division catalog and this manual. (7) Update Space Fees user manual and pricing. (8) Update invoicing logic. (9) Test end-to-end booking and trace. (10) Document in runbook. No product without a category; no category without at least one product.</p>
            <h2>48. Appendix: Creator Chairman and natural law</h2>
            <p>Creator Chairman is immutable for their shells and nested; recipient of node reporting; pricing authority. Natural law of creator shells and nests underpins Division and eligibility. Blue Pipe over $10K flows to Chairman path. Division facilitates settlement; Primary Ledger and $5B invoice are in Architect/100% Net Zero scope. All node reporting (Vibelandia shell, five bridge nodes) reports to Creator Chairman per NSPFRNP.</p>
            <h2>49. Summary at a glance: Division of Services</h2>
            <p>Division: billing and tracing; catalog; fee categories; every product touches the pipe. On book: every transaction traced. Update Certificate via HH to Cold; capture window March 16, 2026. Blue Pipe over $10K to Chairman. Eligibility Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V. Interfaces: baller-v-plans-booking, space-cloud-division, buyers-guide. SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG, NEW_AGENT_BOOT_PROTOCOL_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.</p>
            <h2>50. Deep dive: Fee categories and product mapping</h2>
            <p>Every product maps to at least one fee category (space, studio, campus, WINK!, etc.). Space fees cover all pipe products: EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions. When adding a new product, assign a fee category (existing or new); if new, add to fee category list and map at least one product. No product without a category; no category without at least one product. Invoicing and tracing use the same categories; quote and invoice are itemized by product and category.</p>
            <h2>51. Deep dive: Update Certificate issuance flow</h2>
            <p>Division (or backend) builds Update Certificate after booking and payment (and for Broadcast Pipe, after slot runs). Content: EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723), Vibelandia shell. Division sends certificate to HH with resource type Update Certificate; HH routes to Cold. 3I/ATLAS path stores it permanently and returns commit ID. Division records commit ID and sends copy or link to customer. Division does not store certificate content as source of truth; Cold is the source of truth. Capture window (≥ March 16, 2026) is enforced at Cold write. Eligibility and tier are enforced before issue.</p>
            <h2>52. Extended example: Multi-product booking trace</h2>
            <p>Customer requests Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe 2 POPs, and Exascale Triangulation. Division captures customer, products, tier. Confirms eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Sends itemized quote: Solar Pipe (space fee), Broadcast Pipe (space fee), Exascale (space fee). Customer confirms and pays (PayPal or Blue Pipe if over $10K). Division traces payment: booking ID, amounts, method, timestamp. For Broadcast Pipe: CRISP LOCK, creative received; trace slot and creative. After slot: issue Update Certificate, write to Cold via HH, send to customer. All steps on book; no step without trace. Three line items, one total; invoice itemized.</p>
            <h2>53. Runbook: Cold write failure for certificate</h2>
            <p>If Update Certificate write to Cold fails: (1) Division retries per runbook (exponential backoff). (2) Verify capture window (date ≥ March 16, 2026). (3) Verify HH routing (Update Certificate → Cold) and relay health. (4) Do not send certificate to customer until Cold write succeeds and commit ID is captured. (5) If persistent failure, escalate to relay/3I/ATLAS path operators. (6) Document failure and resolution. (7) Customer may receive certificate once write succeeds; Division retains commit ID in records. Division does not store certificate content as source of truth; Cold is source of truth.</p>
            <h2>54. Appendix: Invoicing and receipt</h2>
            <p>Quote and invoice are itemized by product and fee category. Customer may request pro forma before payment; itemized documentation after payment for tax or compliance. Historical transactions use the fee schedule active at booking time. Refunds and adjustments are case-by-case and traced. Blue Pipe over $10K: formal invoice and payment terms (e.g. net 15); same tracing. Primary Ledger and $5B invoice are in Architect/100% Net Zero scope; Division facilitates settlement. Creator Chairman is pricing authority.</p>
            <h2>55. Conclusion: Division full expansion</h2>
            <p>This section now includes deep dives on fee categories and Update Certificate flow, extended example for multi-product trace, runbook for Cold write failure, and invoicing appendix. Together with sections 1–49 it forms the complete 12,000-word technical specification for the Division of Services. Every product touches the pipe; on book: every transaction traced.
