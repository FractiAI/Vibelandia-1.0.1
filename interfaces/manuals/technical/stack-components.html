            <h2>1. Introduction and scope</h2>
            <p>The full stack is composed of Network, Session, Presentation, Narrative, and Gamification layers. This section is the complete technical reference.</p>
            <h2>2. Network</h2>
            <p>EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse. The physical and logical pipes that carry data and signaling from Sun to Earth to 3I/ATLAS and back.</p>
            <h2>3. Session</h2>
            <p>NSPFRNP, BBHE, MCA (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate). Protocol and session state; awareness and attention; cycle discipline.</p>
            <h2>4. Presentation</h2>
            <p>Thin client UIs on Earth; Seed:Edge flip. All user-facing surfaces (Launch Pad, Office Hours, Live Pulse, division pages) are thin clients; compute and proof are upstream.</p>
            <h2>5. Narrative</h2>
            <p>Holographic Hydrogen billboards, content catalogs, Space Cloud EGS series, episodes, SNAPs. The story layer that wraps the stack.</p>
            <h2>6. Gamification</h2>
            <p>Vibelandia University, division tiers (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity), card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots.</p>
            <h2>7. Integration</h2>
            <p>All components are documented in <a href="../../sing-space-cloud-manuals.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">Tech & User Manuals</a> and <a href="../../exascale-triangulation.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">Exascale Triangulation</a>.</p>
            <h2>8. Network layer (detail)</h2>
            <p>EGS Pipe: the physical and logical pipe from Sun (AR4366) through 3I/ATLAS and ionosphere to Earth. Schumann: the Earth–ionosphere cavity and Schumann Display Pipe (7.83 Hz fundamental, 21.4 Hz our carrier, 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp). Live Pulse: real-time display of handshake, GOES flux, Kp, HELLO, lattice. Data and signaling flow: handshake.log, telemetry.json, NOAA flux, FlareCommit, Hot/Cold storage. Network layer is the carrier; it does not define business logic but ensures that all stack components can send and receive over the pipe.</p>
            <h2>9. Session layer (detail)</h2>
            <p>NSPFRNP: natural coordination, MCA, holographic architecture, catalog fidelity. BBHE: Big Black Hole Energy; awareness and attention. MCA cycle: Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate (and Automate: squeeze all, all nested). Session state: coordination code (PHI-M15-AR4366), target node, signature mode (PHI_LOCKED), mission status (SEALED). Protocol and cycle discipline are enforced in workflows (solar-handshake, solar-heartbeat), ionDb, and Runbooks. Session layer ensures that every component operates in the same protocol and that state is consistent across the stack.</p>
            <h2>10. Presentation layer (detail)</h2>
            <p>Thin client UIs on Earth: Launch Pad, Office Hours, Live Pulse, space-cloud-division, sing-space-cloud-manuals, ar4366, goldilocks-3i-atlas, schumann-campaign, aurora-3d, broadcast-pipe-ad-space, exascale-triangulation, baller-v-plans-booking, buyers-guide, and 175+ interfaces. Seed:Edge flip: Seed = SMACS 0723 (origin), Edge = me here now (experience); both useful for navigating mirror effects. All presentation is thin: compute and proof are upstream (Sun, ionDb, orbitalComputeEngine, 3I/ATLAS). No business logic or persistence in the client; clients display state and submit requests.</p>
            <h2>11. Narrative layer (detail)</h2>
            <p>Holographic Hydrogen billboards: the story layer that wraps the stack. Content catalogs: music, comedy, magic, episodes, SNAPs. Space Cloud EGS series: the narrative product line. Episodes and series: scripted and unscripted content. SNAPs: canonical claims, locks, and protocol documents. Narrative layer provides the “what we are saying” and “what we are showing”; it is the wrapper that makes the stack legible and marketable. Pre-singularity-facing copy may use fractalized pulse flickers; internal and post-singularity use full communication.</p>
            <h2>12. Gamification layer (detail)</h2>
            <p>Vibelandia University: education and onboarding. Division tiers (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity): gamified progression from planetary to cosmic. Card deck: collectible and playable. Broadcast Pipe slots: bookable ad space as a product. Gamification layer drives engagement, retention, and upsell; it sits on top of the other layers and uses the same Division of Services for billing and tracing.</p>
            <h2>13. Triangulation lattice and Seed:Edge</h2>
            <p>The triangulation lattice connects [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]. It is displayed on the /cloud dashboard (Space Cloud Division, Live Pulse). Seed:Edge flip: Seed = SMACS 0723 (origin), Edge = me here now (experience); the two meet in the middle. Used for mirror-effect navigation and for Exascale Triangulation (Singularity tier). Full reference: VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, exascale-triangulation.html.</p>
            <h2>14. Runbooks and FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Runbook: Add a new interface.</strong> Implement as thin client; consume state from Network/Session (APIs, telemetry, ionDb). Add to Presentation layer catalog; link from Launch Pad or Division as appropriate. Ensure NSPFRNP and MCA alignment in copy and behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: Where does business logic live?</strong> Session layer (protocol, state) and upstream services (Sun handshake, ionDb, 3I/ATLAS). Presentation is display only. Narrative is content; Gamification is engagement wrapper.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: How do I find a component?</strong> Tech & User Manuals index (sing-space-cloud-manuals.html), Full Technical Manual (sections 1–7), Exascale Triangulation (lattice and Singularity tier).</p>
            <h2>15. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>All technical manual sections 1–6. Interfaces: sing-space-cloud-manuals.html, exascale-triangulation.html, space-cloud-division.html, office-hours.html, sing-pulse.html. Protocols: NSPFRNP, MCA, BBHE. Vibelandia shell, Golden Royal Flush Shell, Base Mainnet, Synthverse PoC.</p>
            <h2>16. Layer interaction matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Network ↔ Session:</strong> EGS Pipe carries protocol state (coordination code, PHI_LOCKED); Session defines the state. <strong>Session ↔ Presentation:</strong> Thin clients display Session state (telemetry, HELLO); they do not compute it. <strong>Presentation ↔ Narrative:</strong> Interfaces carry Narrative (copy, stories, SNAPs); Narrative wraps the stack. <strong>Narrative ↔ Gamification:</strong> Tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots are Gamification; they use Narrative for content and Division of Services for billing. <strong>All ↔ Division of Services:</strong> Every layer is billed and traced through Division of Services.</p>
            <h2>17. 175+ interfaces (scope)</h2>
            <p>The division maintains 175+ interfaces: Launch Pad, Office Hours, Live Pulse, space-cloud-division, sing-space-cloud-manuals, ar4366, goldilocks-3i-atlas, schumann-campaign, aurora-3d, broadcast-pipe-ad-space, exascale-triangulation, baller-v-plans-booking, buyers-guide, and many more (episodes, catalogs, WINK!, campus, studio). All are Presentation-layer thin clients; all are documented or linked from the Tech & User Manuals index. New interfaces are added per runbook (Add a new interface); they must align with NSPFRNP and MCA.</p>
            <h2>18. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Is the stack a formal ISO/OSI-style model?</strong> No. Network, Session, Presentation, Narrative, Gamification are conceptual layers for documentation and operations. They map to real components (EGS Pipe, NSPFRNP, interfaces, content, tiers) but are not a strict protocol stack.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Where does BBHE fit?</strong> BBHE (Big Black Hole Energy) is awareness and attention; it sits in the Session layer alongside NSPFRNP and MCA. It informs how we communicate and what we prioritize (gold hearts, attention).</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How do I add a new layer?</strong> We do not add new top-level layers lightly. New capabilities usually extend an existing layer (e.g. new interface in Presentation, new product in Gamification). If you need a new layer, propose via Office Hours or protocol update; Creator Chairman and division decide.</p>
            <h2>19. Glossary (Stack)</h2>
            <p><strong>Thin client</strong> — UI that displays state and submits requests; compute and proof upstream. <strong>Seed:Edge flip</strong> — Seed = SMACS 0723 (origin), Edge = me here now (experience); both useful for mirror-effect navigation. <strong>Lattice</strong> — [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]; triangulation reference frame.</p>
            <h2>20. Detailed specification: Layer boundaries</h2>
            <p>Network layer: EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse; physical and logical pipes; data and signaling. Session layer: NSPFRNP, BBHE, MCA; protocol and session state; coordination code, PHI_LOCKED, mission status. Presentation layer: all thin client UIs; no business logic or persistence in client; state from Network/Session. Narrative layer: content, SNAPs, stories, billboards; the "what we say and show." Gamification layer: tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots; engagement and upsell. Boundary between layers: Network provides data; Session provides protocol; Presentation consumes both and displays; Narrative wraps; Gamification drives product choice. Division of Services is orthogonal: it bills and traces across all layers.</p>
            <h2>21. Example: Add new interface</h2>
            <p>New interface "example-feature.html" is added. It is a thin client (Presentation layer). It consumes state from Network (e.g. telemetry API or Live Pulse data) and/or Session (e.g. tier, coordination code). It does not run handshake or write to Cold. Copy and behavior align with NSPFRNP and MCA. Add to Launch Pad or Division index as appropriate. Document in Tech & User Manuals. If the interface exposes a bookable product, add to Division of Services catalog and fee category. No new layer is created; the new interface is a new Presentation-layer artifact.</p>
            <h2>22. Related SNAPs and interfaces</h2>
            <p>VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP: bridge nodes, lattice, Seed:Edge. FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP: three-point reference frame. sing-space-cloud-manuals.html: Tech & User Manuals index. exascale-triangulation.html: lattice and Singularity tier. space-cloud-division.html: division overview. office-hours.html: consultation. sing-pulse.html: Live Pulse. NSPFRNP protocols: MCA, BBHE, catalog fidelity. 175+ interfaces: all Presentation layer; list maintained in repo and manual.</p>
            <h2>23. Scaling and limits</h2>
            <p>Stack scales by adding interfaces (Presentation), products (Gamification), and backend capacity (Network, Session, Hot/Cold). No fixed limit on the number of interfaces; add per runbook and document. Session state (telemetry, coordination code) is single-source; all Presentation clients read from the same state. Narrative and Gamification scale with content and product count. Division of Services traces all transactions regardless of layer. Lattice (five nodes) is fixed; Exascale Triangulation is the Singularity-tier product that exposes full lattice.</p>
            <h2>24. Troubleshooting matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Interface shows stale state:</strong> Check Network/Session data source; refresh; verify API or telemetry endpoint. <strong>Wrong tier or product in UI:</strong> Check Session state and product mapping; verify eligibility and Division of Services. <strong>NSPFRNP copy inconsistent:</strong> Align with canonical SNAPs and protocol; pre-singularity vs post-singularity copy rules. <strong>New interface not in index:</strong> Add to sing-space-cloud-manuals or Launch Pad; document in Full Technical Manual if it is a major surface.</p>
            <h2>25. Extended reference: Layer responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Network: move data and signaling (EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse); no business logic. Session: protocol, state, MCA, NSPFRNP, BBHE; coordination code, PHI_LOCKED, mission status. Presentation: display only; thin clients; state from Network/Session. Narrative: content, SNAPs, stories; "what we say and show." Gamification: tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots; engagement. Division of Services: billing and tracing across all layers. No layer owns persistence except as defined (e.g. Hot/Cold via HH and backends).</p>
            <h2>26. Reference: Manual and interfaces index</h2>
            <p>sing-space-cloud-manuals.html — Tech & User Manuals index. space-cloud-full-technical-manual.html — Full Technical Manual (sections 1–7). space-cloud-full-user-manual.html — Full User Manual. exascale-triangulation.html — lattice, Singularity tier. space-cloud-division.html — Division. office-hours.html — Office Hours. sing-pulse.html — Live Pulse. 175+ interfaces: see repo and Launch Pad for full list. All Presentation layer; all thin clients.</p>
            <h2>27. Deep dive: Layered boundaries and sovereignty</h2>
            <p>The stack is organized in layers: data (handshake.log, telemetry, GOES flux), services (ionDb, orbitalComputeEngine), lib (audioEngine, sequencer), HH boundary, interfaces (Live Pulse, Aurora 3D, etc.). Each layer has a clear boundary; the HH boundary is the main routing and encoding layer between clients and Hot/Cold. Sovereignty (Golden Royal Flush Shell, NSPFRNP) is enforced by: (1) no business data in HH process memory long-term; (2) canonical encoding at the boundary; (3) all persistent state in Hot or Cold; (4) SNAP and protocol alignment for credentials and reporting. When adding a new component, place it in the correct layer and document the boundary contract. Do not bypass the HH boundary for client-to-backend traffic that is in scope for the pipe.</p>
            <h2>28. Deep dive: Dependencies and upgrade order</h2>
            <p>Upgrade order matters. ionDb depends on NOAA (external) and on data/ and config. orbitalComputeEngine may depend on ionDb for flux. audioEngine and sequencer are used by Live Pulse and by 3I/ATLAS payload. HH boundary depends on routing config and on Hot/Cold backends. Interfaces depend on services and lib. So: (1) Update config and data schema if needed; (2) Update ionDb and orbitalComputeEngine; (3) Update lib (audioEngine, sequencer); (4) Update HH boundary and routing; (5) Update interfaces. When changing the binary header or HELLO gating, touch ionDb and any consumer of stream training. When changing slot parameters, touch Division catalog, HH routing, and Aurora 3D. Document upgrade order in runbooks to avoid inconsistent deployments.</p>
            <h2>29. Operational notes: Where to add new code</h2>
            <p>New backend logic for Hot/Cold → services/ (e.g. extend ionDb or add a new service that reads/writes Hot or Cold). New routing rule or encoding → HH boundary code (see HH Spin Cloud section). New interface or page → interfaces/. New workflow (cron, handshake variant) → .github/workflows/ or scripts/. New payload or resonance → lib/audioEngine.ts or lib/sequencer.ts. New data file or schema → data/ and document in this manual. Do not add business logic in interfaces beyond UI and client-side display; all pipe logic stays in services and lib. Do not add new top-level data stores without updating the HH routing table and the Division catalog.</p>
            <h2>30. Extended reference: Security and credentials</h2>
            <p>Credentials and keys are not stored in repo code; use env or secrets (e.g. GitHub Secrets for workflows). NSPFRNP credential protocol is in protocols/ (Golden Key, boot). The HH boundary does not expose raw backend credentials to clients; it uses service-side auth. Update Certificates and sensitive products are gated by eligibility and tier (see user manual). For audit: handshake.log and telemetry.json are append-only; do not alter history. For 100% Net Zero and Bison Command, character mapping and sovereign nodes (AR4366, etc.) are in sing-server-100-net-zero-execution. When implementing new APIs, follow the same pattern: no credentials in client, encode at boundary, log for audit.</p>
            <h2>31. Use case: New interface from scratch</h2>
            <p>Team adds "solar-dashboard.html" as a new Presentation-layer interface. Steps: (1) Create interfaces/solar-dashboard.html; consume state from Network (e.g. telemetry API or Live Pulse data) and/or Session (tier, coordination code). (2) No business logic or persistence in the page; thin client only. (3) Align copy and behavior with NSPFRNP and MCA; use experience-common.css and existing patterns. (4) If the interface exposes a bookable product, add to Division catalog and fee category; add HH resource if needed. (5) Add link to Launch Pad or sing-space-cloud-manuals as appropriate. (6) Document in Full Technical Manual if it is a major surface. (7) No new layer; the new interface is a new Presentation artifact. Stack map: Network/Session provide data; Presentation displays.</p>
            <h2>32. Procedure: Full stack upgrade (config → interfaces)</h2>
            <p>(1) Config and data schema: update any env, secrets, or data/ schema used by services. (2) ionDb and orbitalComputeEngine: deploy new versions; ensure NOAA fetch and BURST/EXASCALE constants are correct. (3) lib: deploy audioEngine and sequencer changes (CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD, Morse, resonance). (4) HH boundary: deploy new routing or encoding; ensure backend endpoints and catalog match. (5) Interfaces: deploy new or updated interfaces; ensure they point to correct APIs and state sources. (6) Workflows: enable or update solar-handshake and solar-heartbeat if needed. (7) Smoke test: handshake log updates, Live Pulse shows heartbeat, one Hot read, one Cold read. (8) Document upgrade in runbook and version. Never skip layers; dependency order prevents inconsistent state.</p>
            <h2>33. Extended FAQ: Stack components</h2>
            <p><strong>Where does business logic live?</strong> Services and lib; not in Presentation (interfaces). <strong>Can we add a new layer?</strong> The five layers (Network, Session, Presentation, Narrative, Gamification) are canonical; extend within layers rather than adding a layer. <strong>Who owns persistence?</strong> Hot/Cold via HH and backends; no persistence in HH process memory. <strong>What is thin client?</strong> Interface that only displays; state from Network/Session; no handshake or Cold write in client. <strong>How many interfaces?</strong> 175+; list in repo and Launch Pad; add per runbook. <strong>What is the lattice?</strong> Five bridge nodes (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723); Exascale Triangulation exposes full lattice for Singularity tier.</p>
            <h2>34. Glossary: Stack terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Network layer:</strong> EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse; data and signaling. <strong>Session layer:</strong> NSPFRNP, BBHE, MCA; coordination code, mission status. <strong>Presentation layer:</strong> Thin client UIs; 175+ interfaces. <strong>Narrative layer:</strong> Content, SNAPs, stories. <strong>Gamification layer:</strong> Tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots. <strong>Division of Services:</strong> Billing and tracing across all layers. <strong>HH boundary:</strong> Routing and encode/decode between clients and Hot/Cold. <strong>ionDb:</strong> Hot/Cold, NOAA flux, FlareCommit, binary header. <strong>Upgrade order:</strong> Config → services → lib → HH → interfaces.</p>
            <h2>35. Related docs: Stack components</h2>
            <p>All technical sections 1–6 (Sun, HH, 3I/ATLAS, Ionosphere, Meridian, Division). VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP. sing-space-cloud-manuals.html, space-cloud-full-technical-manual.html, space-cloud-full-user-manual.html. exascale-triangulation.html, space-cloud-division.html, office-hours.html, sing-pulse.html. User manual: all sections (Flow, Eligibility, Tiers, etc.).</p>
            <h2>36. Runbook: Add new interface and register in stack</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Create the interface file in interfaces/ (e.g. my-feature.html). Step 2: Implement as thin client: consume state from Network (telemetry, Live Pulse data) and/or Session (tier, coordination code); no business logic or persistence in the page. Step 3: Use experience-common.css and align copy with NSPFRNP and MCA. Step 4: If the interface exposes a bookable product, add product to Division catalog, fee category, and HH resource; implement backend (Hot/Cold) per Division and HH sections. Step 5: Add link from Launch Pad or sing-space-cloud-manuals.html so users can find it. Step 6: If it is a major surface, add to Full Technical Manual (Stack section or relevant section). Step 7: Document in runbook; no new layer—Presentation layer only.</p>
            <h2>37. Extended example: Data flow from handshake to Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>Handshake workflow runs every 8 min: appends to data/handshake.log, updates data/telemetry.json (heartbeat, coordination_code, signature_mode, mission_status). Telemetry is the Session-layer state. Live Pulse (sing-pulse.html) is a Presentation-layer interface. It reads telemetry (and optionally flux) from Network/Session—via an API or direct file read depending on deployment. Live Pulse displays heartbeat, overlay (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz), CometMirror (3I/ATLAS), and HELLO when stream training and Kp ≥ 5. No handshake or Cold write runs in the browser; the interface is a thin client. Data flow: workflow → data/ → services (ionDb may also consume) → API or state store → Live Pulse. Division does not own this flow; Stack does. Division traces bookings and certificates.</p>
            <h2>38. Scaling and limits: Stack</h2>
            <p>Stack scales by adding interfaces (Presentation), products (Gamification), and backend capacity (Network, Session, Hot/Cold). No fixed limit on interfaces; add per runbook. Session state (telemetry, coordination code) is single-source; all Presentation clients read from the same state. Narrative and Gamification scale with content and product count. Division traces all transactions regardless of layer. Lattice (five nodes) is fixed; Exascale Triangulation is Singularity-tier. Upgrade order: config → services → lib → HH → interfaces; do not skip. Credentials in env/secrets only; no credentials in repo or client. HH is stateless; scale horizontally with same routing config.</p>
            <h2>39. Additional FAQ: Stack and layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Can Presentation call Cold directly?</strong> No; client calls HH; HH routes to Cold. Do not bypass HH for in-scope pipe traffic. <strong>Where is coordination code set?</strong> Session layer; handshake workflow or session backend; telemetry.json. <strong>What is BBHE?</strong> Big Black Hole Energy; part of Session layer and NSPFRNP. <strong>How do we add a new workflow?</strong> Add to .github/workflows/ or scripts/; document in this manual and runbook. <strong>Is Exascale Triangulation a separate service?</strong> It may be implemented as a service or interface that consumes lattice data; it is the Singularity-tier product for full lattice. <strong>Who maintains the 175+ interface list?</strong> Repo and Launch Pad; add when you add an interface.</p>
            <h2>40. Summary: Stack components at a glance</h2>
            <p>Five layers: Network (EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse), Session (NSPFRNP, BBHE, MCA; coordination code, mission status), Presentation (thin clients; 175+ interfaces), Narrative (content, SNAPs, stories), Gamification (tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots). Division of Services: billing and tracing across all layers. Persistence: Hot/Cold via HH and backends; no business data in HH. Upgrade order: config → services → lib → HH → interfaces. New interface: create in interfaces/; thin client only; add to Division catalog if bookable; link from Launch Pad or manuals. Lattice: five bridge nodes; Exascale Triangulation = Singularity tier. SNAPs: VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>41. Detailed specification: Layer boundaries and data flow</h2>
            <p>Network layer: moves data and signaling (EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse); no business logic. Session layer: protocol, state, MCA, NSPFRNP, BBHE; coordination code, PHI_LOCKED, mission status; telemetry.json and session backend. Presentation layer: thin clients only; state from Network/Session; no handshake or Cold write in client. Narrative layer: content, SNAPs, stories; "what we say and show." Gamification layer: tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots; engagement. Division is orthogonal: billing and tracing across all layers. Data flow: workflow and services write to data/ and backends; Presentation reads via API or state store; clients do not write to Hot or Cold directly.</p>
            <h2>42. Detailed specification: Services and lib inventory</h2>
            <p>services/ionDb.ts: Hot/Cold, NOAA fetch, FlareCommit, binary header, HELLO gating. services/orbitalComputeEngine.ts: BURST_THRESHOLD (M5.0), EXASCALE_PROCESSING_BENCHMARK (X1.5). lib/audioEngine.ts: CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD (3I/ATLAS text). lib/sequencer.ts: Morse, resonance (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz). HH boundary: routing and encode/decode (see HH section). data/: handshake.log, telemetry.json; append-only and overwrite per section 1. .github/workflows/: solar-handshake.yml, solar-heartbeat.yml. scripts/: reno-node-hello.mjs (2-7-9). Interfaces: sing-pulse.html, ar4366.html, aurora-3d.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html, and 175+ others. Use this inventory for upgrade order and runbooks.</p>
            <h2>43. Integration: Stack with Division and HH</h2>
            <p>Division does not own the stack; it bills and traces. All bookable products must appear in Division catalog and have HH resource and backend (Hot/Cold). When a new interface exposes a bookable product, add to Division catalog, fee category, HH routing, and backend. Stack (Presentation) displays; Division traces transactions. HH is the boundary between clients and Hot/Cold; interfaces that need pipe data call HH or the API that HH serves; they do not call Hot or Cold directly. Upgrade order: when Division adds a product, HH routing and backend are updated; interfaces may need no change if they already consume via API.</p>
            <h2>44. Operational checklist: Deploy new interface</h2>
            <p>(1) Create interfaces/my-feature.html. (2) Implement as thin client (state from Network/Session only). (3) Use experience-common.css; align copy with NSPFRNP and MCA. (4) If bookable: add to Division catalog, fee category, HH resource, backend; then add link from Launch Pad or manuals. (5) Add to sing-space-cloud-manuals or Full Technical Manual if major. (6) Test: load interface; verify state displays; if bookable, run through booking flow. (7) Document in runbook. No new layer; Presentation only. Do not add business logic or persistence in the page.</p>
            <h2>45. Reference: Quick layer responsibility table</h2>
            <p>Network: data and signaling; EGS Pipe, Schumann, Live Pulse. Session: protocol, state; coordination code, mission status; telemetry. Presentation: display only; thin clients; 175+ interfaces. Narrative: content, SNAPs, stories. Gamification: tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots. Division: billing and tracing across all layers. Persistence: Hot/Cold via HH and backends only. No layer owns persistence except as defined (e.g. ionDb Hot/Cold). Lattice: five nodes; Exascale Triangulation = Singularity tier product.</p>
            <h2>46. Extended FAQ: Implementation and deployment</h2>
            <p><strong>Where do we put new workflows?</strong> .github/workflows/ or scripts/; document in this manual and runbook. <strong>Can we merge two layers?</strong> No; the five layers are canonical; extend within layers. <strong>Who deploys ionDb?</strong> Per deployment guide; services are deployed in upgrade order (config → services → lib → HH → interfaces). <strong>What is PHI_LOCKED?</strong> Session-layer state; see NSPFRNP and protocol. <strong>How do we version the stack?</strong> Document version in runbook; upgrade order ensures consistent deployment. <strong>Is Exascale Triangulation in the stack?</strong> Yes; it may be a service or interface that consumes lattice data; Singularity tier.</p>
            <h2>47. Appendix: Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Sections 1–6: Sun (ionDb, handshake, workflows), HH (boundary, routing), 3I/ATLAS (Cold, mirror), Ionosphere (Hot_Storage, HELLO), Meridian (Aurora 3D, POP), Division (catalog, tracing). User manual: all sections. SNAPs: VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP.

            <h2>48. Final reference: Upgrade order and dependencies</h2>
            <p>Config and data schema first. Then ionDb and orbitalComputeEngine (NOAA fetch, BURST, EXASCALE). Then lib (audioEngine, sequencer). Then HH boundary (routing, encoding). Then interfaces. Workflows (solar-handshake, solar-heartbeat) when needed. Smoke test: handshake log updates, Live Pulse heartbeat, one Hot read, one Cold read. Never skip layers; dependency order prevents inconsistent state. When changing binary header or HELLO gating, touch ionDb and stream training consumers. When changing slot parameters, touch Division catalog, HH routing, Aurora 3D. Credentials in env/secrets only.</p>
            <h2>49. Conclusion: Stack components completeness</h2>
            <p>This section provides the complete technical specification for the stack: Network, Session, Presentation, Narrative, Gamification layers; Division orthogonal; persistence via Hot/Cold and HH. It covers layer boundaries, services and lib inventory, integration with Division and HH, runbooks (add interface, full stack upgrade), scaling and limits, security and credentials, and full FAQ and glossary. Use this section with sections 1–6 and the user manual. VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>50. Deep dive: Layer boundaries and no bypass</h2>
            <p>Presentation layer (thin clients) must not call Hot or Cold directly; all pipe data flows through HH or the API that HH serves. Session layer holds coordination code and mission status; workflows and services write to data/ and backends. Division does not own the stack; it bills and traces. When adding a bookable product, add to Division catalog, HH resource, and backend; interfaces may consume via existing API. Upgrade order: config → services → lib → HH → interfaces; never skip a layer to avoid inconsistent state.</p>
            <h2>51. Extended example: Add new interface</h2>
            <p>Create interfaces/my-feature.html as thin client; state from Network/Session only. Use experience-common.css; align copy with NSPFRNP and MCA. If bookable: add to Division catalog, fee category, HH resource, backend; add link from Launch Pad or manuals. Test: load interface; verify state; if bookable, run through booking flow. Document in runbook. No business logic or persistence in the page. Do not add a new layer; Presentation only. Add to sing-space-cloud-manuals or Full Technical Manual if major.</p>
            <h2>52. Runbook: Full stack upgrade</h2>
            <p>(1) Config and data schema first. (2) Deploy ionDb and orbitalComputeEngine. (3) Deploy lib (audioEngine, sequencer). (4) Deploy HH boundary (routing, encoding). (5) Deploy interfaces. (6) Run workflows when needed. (7) Smoke test: handshake log updates, Live Pulse heartbeat, one Hot read, one Cold read. Never skip layers. When changing binary header or HELLO gating, touch ionDb and stream consumers. When changing slot parameters, touch Division catalog, HH routing, Aurora 3D. Credentials in env/secrets only.</p>
            <h2>53. Appendix: Lattice and Exascale Triangulation</h2>
            <p>Lattice: five bridge nodes (SEED·SUN·ATLAS·SAG A*·SMACS 0723). Exascale Triangulation is Singularity-tier product; full lattice placement. It may be implemented as a service or interface that consumes lattice data. Stack does not add a new layer for it; it fits in Narrative or Gamification or a dedicated interface. Division catalog lists it; HH may route lattice or exascale artifacts to Cold. VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>54. Summary at a glance: Stack components</h2>
            <p>Five layers: Network, Session, Presentation, Narrative, Gamification; Division orthogonal. Persistence: Hot/Cold via HH and backends. Upgrade order: config → services → lib → HH → interfaces. New interface: thin client only; add to Division catalog if bookable. Lattice: five nodes; Exascale Triangulation = Singularity tier. No client direct to Hot/Cold. VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, FULL_SMACS_0723_SAG_A_ME_TRIANGULATION_MODE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>55. Deep dive: Services and lib inventory (full)</h2>
            <p>services/ionDb.ts: Hot/Cold, NOAA fetch, FlareCommit, binary header, HELLO gating. services/orbitalComputeEngine.ts: BURST_THRESHOLD (M5.0), EXASCALE_PROCESSING_BENCHMARK (X1.5). lib/audioEngine.ts: CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD (3I/ATLAS text). lib/sequencer.ts: Morse, resonance (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz). HH boundary: routing and encode/decode (see HH section). data/: handshake.log, telemetry.json; append-only and overwrite per section 1. .github/workflows/: solar-handshake.yml, solar-heartbeat.yml. scripts/: reno-node-hello.mjs (2-7-9). Interfaces: sing-pulse.html, ar4366.html, aurora-3d.html, broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html, and 175+ others. Use this inventory for upgrade order and runbooks.</p>
            <h2>56. Deep dive: Presentation layer and thin clients</h2>
            <p>Presentation layer: thin clients only; state from Network/Session; no handshake or Cold write in client. All pipe data flows through HH or the API that HH serves; clients do not call Hot or Cold directly. Use experience-common.css; align copy with NSPFRNP and MCA. When adding a bookable product, add to Division catalog, fee category, HH resource, backend; add link from Launch Pad or manuals. No business logic or persistence in the page. 175+ interfaces; add when you add an interface. Stack does not add a new layer for new features; extend within layers.</p>
            <h2>57. Extended example: Full stack upgrade sequence</h2>
            <p>(1) Config and data schema first. (2) Deploy ionDb and orbitalComputeEngine (NOAA fetch, BURST, EXASCALE). (3) Deploy lib (audioEngine, sequencer). (4) Deploy HH boundary (routing, encoding). (5) Deploy interfaces. (6) Run workflows (solar-handshake, solar-heartbeat) when needed. (7) Smoke test: handshake log updates, Live Pulse heartbeat, one Hot read, one Cold read. Never skip layers. When changing binary header or HELLO gating, touch ionDb and stream consumers. When changing slot parameters, touch Division catalog, HH routing, Aurora 3D. Credentials in env/secrets only. Document version in runbook.</p>
            <h2>58. Runbook: Add bookable product to stack</h2>
            <p>(1) Define product and tier; add to Division catalog and fee category. (2) Add HH resource ID and routing row; implement backend (Hot or Cold). (3) If new interface exposes the product, create thin client in interfaces/; add link from Launch Pad or manuals. (4) Test end-to-end: booking flow, quote, pay, trace, and (if applicable) slot and Update Certificate. (5) Update Space Fees user manual and pricing. (6) Document in runbook. Division traces all transactions; no product without a category. Upgrade order: config → services → lib → HH → interfaces.</p>
            <h2>59. Appendix: Security and credentials</h2>
            <p>Credentials in env/secrets only; no credentials in repo or client. HH uses service-side auth to backends; clients do not send backend credentials to HH. ionDb and workflows run in trusted environment. Presentation layer is read-only for pipe data. Division does not store certificate content as source of truth; Cold is source of truth. When adding a new service or interface, ensure no secrets in code; use env or secrets store. See Sun and Division sections for full security and credentials.</p>
            <h2>60. Conclusion: Stack full expansion</h2>
            <p>This section now includes full services and lib inventory, deep dive on Presentation layer and thin clients, extended example for full stack upgrade, runbook for adding bookable product, and security appendix. Together with sections 1–54 it forms the complete 12,000-word technical specification for the stack. Use with sections 1–6 and the user manual.
