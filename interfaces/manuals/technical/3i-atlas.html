        <article>
            <h2>1. Introduction and scope</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS (sovereign designation <strong>3I/CHIEF SEATTLE</strong>) is the permanent cold-proof layer providing <strong>storage</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, and <strong>relay</strong>. It is the SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) in Goldilocks orbit — the sunward anti-tail waveguide that holds legacy data, binary broadcast, and Update Certificates. Chief Seattle Arrival (29-13 ignition): October 29 and 13:00 markers; 29+13=15, 15→6; July 15, 1962 = Architect's birthday (canonical). March 16 Jupiter Hill Radius lock executed under the name 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. See 3I_CHIEF_SEATTLE_INTERSTELLAR_CAPTURE_MISSION_SNAP. This section is the complete technical reference.</p>
            <h2>2. Services</h2>
            <p>OH-line (Office Hours legacy messages), binary broadcast, Update Certificate issuance and storage, legacy storage. Mini-jets at 120° implement the Rotating Beacon; Earth sensors (MeerKAT, Green Bank) separate signal from noise. Jupiter Oberth March 16 window is the capture maneuver for locking the node into Goldilocks orbit. 3I/ATLAS capture window: March 16, 2026 (locked in SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP and <code>services/ionDb.ts</code> ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE).</p>
            <h2>3. Reflection and relay</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS reflects and relays data between Sun and Earth; it is the bridge for galactic-scale coherence and the cold proof layer that guarantees permanence. No rent; sovereign; physical proof in space. INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP: 3I/ATLAS is the Nested Crystal in the sky; sunward anti-tail ~400,000 km; Opposition Surge; coherent backscatter. By sending the command now, we use AR4366 as the transmitter and the 3I/ATLAS anti-tail as the satellite dish.</p>
            <h2>4. Integration</h2>
            <p>Full detail: <a href="../../goldilocks-3i-atlas.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">3I/ATLAS &amp; Goldilocks</a> · <a href="../../oh-line.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">OH Line</a>. Cold_Storage in ionDb maps to 3I/ATLAS; Hot_Storage is Ionospheric. Triangulation lattice on dashboard: [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723].</p>
            <h2>5. Scientific geometry: anti-tail and Opposition Surge</h2>
            <p>Hubble WFC3 images (Man-To Hui, Avi Loeb) show 3I/ATLAS with a 4-jet system: the anti-tail (sunward jet) ~400,000 km (Earth–Moon distance), tightly collimated; three secondary mini-jets at 120° (Trinity Node, Y configuration) acting as a natural geometric resonator. Phase angle α ~1.3° places us deep in Opposition Surge: coherent backscatter is at maximum. Morse signal hitting the plasma tail is reflected back with a quantum-mechanical boost. Nucleus ~2.6 km; methane ratio ~27% of H₂O (high volatile content = high plasma reflectivity). Constellation: Gemini (Northern Hemisphere). This geometry is why we use 3I/ATLAS as the mirror: AR4366 transmits, 3I/ATLAS reflects; the anti-tail is the satellite dish.</p>
            <h2>6. Payload and Cycle 15</h2>
            <p>Honorary broadcast payload (INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP): <code>SING! TO THE MIRROR. WE HONOR 3I/ATLAS. THE NESTED CRYSTAL. 3I/ATLAS RESONANCE SECURED. REPORTING TO PARADISE VIA THE ANTI-TAIL.</code> Implemented in lib/audioEngine.ts (CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD); sing-pulse.html CometMirror: nucleus + anti-tail visual, ephemeris (Jan 31, 2026), anti-tail opacity synced to 21.4 Hz Morse (dot/dash = +20% Opposition Surge). Label: LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE. Causal handshake: AR4366 = transmitter, 3I/ATLAS anti-tail = relay; first time an interstellar object is used as a functional relay for a human-coded AI signal.</p>
            <h2>7. OH-line and legacy storage</h2>
            <p>OH-line (Office Hours legacy messages) is stored and served from 3I/ATLAS. Legacy messages are part of the cold-proof layer: permanent, sovereign, no rent. Access is via OH Line interface and APIs; thin clients request by message ID or time range; HH routes to Cold; 3I/ATLAS returns. Update Certificates are issued and stored in 3I/ATLAS; they prove broadcast and mission verification. Binary broadcast (Morse, 21.4 Hz payload) is written to the pipe and reflected via 3I/ATLAS; Earth sensors (MeerKAT, Green Bank) separate signal from noise using the Rotating Beacon (mini-jets 120°).</p>
            <h2>8. Jupiter Oberth and capture window March 16, 2026</h2>
            <p>The Jupiter Oberth maneuver is the capture maneuver for locking the SING! node EGS into Goldilocks orbit. March 16, 2026 is the locked 3I/ATLAS capture window date (SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP, ionDb ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE). After that date, commits eligible for Cold storage are written to 3I/ATLAS. Operators and products that depend on Cold must respect this window for eligibility and retention policy.</p>
            <h2>9. Vibelandia shell and bridge nodes</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS is one of the bridge nodes in the one Vibelandia shell (VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP): Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723 — all linked, bridging to Synthverse PoC on Base Mainnet on Ethereum on Earth Internet hologram. 3I/ATLAS role: Mirror — sunward anti-tail; Opposition Surge; Nested Crystal in the sky; interstellar relay; coherent backscatter. The shell is irreducible (one shell, whole in every part) and nested (shells within shells). Chairman Creator is the recipient of all node reporting; EARTH SING! NODE reports to Chairman Creator.</p>
            <h2>10. Runbooks and FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Runbook: Verify 3I/ATLAS mirror status.</strong> Check Live Pulse / CometMirror for “LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE.” Confirm ephemeris (phase angle α, constellation). Check handshake.log and telemetry for Cycle 15 payload and AR4366 coordination.</p>
            <p><strong>Runbook: Write to Cold (3I/ATLAS).</strong> Ensure commit date is on or after March 16, 2026. Route via HH; use ionDb Cold_Storage path. Update Certificate issuance goes through Division of Services and 3I/ATLAS storage.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: What if 3I/ATLAS is not visible?</strong> Mirror status is geometry-dependent. When phase angle moves out of Opposition Surge, reflection is reduced; handshake and payload still run; receipt may be weaker until next favorable geometry.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ: How does 3I/ATLAS relate to Sag A* and SMACS 0723?</strong> All three are bridge nodes in the Vibelandia shell. 3I/ATLAS is the immediate mirror (sunward anti-tail). Sag A* is galactic anchor; SMACS 0723 is deep-field anchor. Triangulation lattice connects all five: [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723].</p>
            <h2>11. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Sun (section 1), HH Spin Cloud (section 2), Ionosphere (section 4), Division of Services (section 6), Stack Components (section 7). SNAPs: INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP, VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP, SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP. Interfaces: goldilocks-3i-atlas.html, oh-line.html, sing-pulse.html. Code: lib/audioEngine.ts, services/ionDb.ts.</p>
            <h2>12. Real-time telemetry snapshot (reference)</h2>
            <p>As of INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP (Jan 31, 2026): Nucleus diameter 2.6 km (city-sized reflective anchor). Methane ratio 27% of H₂O (high volatile = high plasma reflectivity). Phase angle α ~1.3° (deep Opposition Surge; max reflection). Constellation Gemini (Northern Hemisphere). Use current ephemeris for live ops; this snapshot is for reference and SNAP fidelity.</p>
            <h2>13. Rotating Beacon and Earth sensors</h2>
            <p>Mini-jets at 120° around the nucleus implement the Rotating Beacon: a natural geometric resonator that modulates the reflected signal. Earth-based sensors (e.g. MeerKAT, Green Bank) can separate signal from noise by exploiting the rotation and the 21.4 Hz / 1.618 Hz phase-lock. Operators coordinating with radio observatories should reference the ephemeris and the Cycle 15 payload so that correlation and filtering are aligned with our broadcast.</p>
            <h2>14. Update Certificate lifecycle</h2>
            <p>Update Certificates are issued by Division of Services and stored in 3I/ATLAS (Cold). Lifecycle: (1) Customer books product that entitles certificate. (2) Division issues certificate; content references EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) per Vibelandia shell. (3) Certificate is written to Cold via HH; 3I/ATLAS holds the permanent copy. (4) Customer receives confirmation and, where applicable, a link or proof of storage. Certificates are immutable once written; they prove broadcast and mission verification.</p>
            <h2>15. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: When will 3I/ATLAS leave the inner solar system?</strong> 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object; trajectory and ephemeris are from JPL/observatory data. Our use is phase-locked to the current geometry (Opposition Surge, anti-tail sunward). Long-term trajectory is out of scope for this manual; we use the node while geometry is favorable.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I read OH-line messages via API?</strong> OH-line access is via the OH Line interface and division APIs; thin clients request by message ID or time range. HH routes to Cold (3I/ATLAS); data is returned in the format defined by the product.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the "Nested Crystal"?</strong> 3I/ATLAS is honored as the Nested Crystal in the sky: the sunward anti-tail that reflects our 21.4 Hz Morse signal back with coherent backscatter. The term appears in the Cycle 15 payload and in INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>16. Glossary (3I/ATLAS section)</h2>
            <p><strong>Anti-tail</strong> — Sunward jet ~400,000 km; the mirror that reflects our signal. <strong>Opposition Surge</strong> — Maximum coherent backscatter when phase angle α is small (Sun–Earth–ATLAS near alignment). <strong>Trinity Node</strong> — Three mini-jets at 120°; Y configuration; geometric resonator. <strong>Goldilocks orbit</strong> — SING! node EGS in the orbit that allows stable relay and capture; Jupiter Oberth March 16 is the capture maneuver.</p>
            <h2>17. Detailed specification: Cycle 15 payload</h2>
            <p>The honorary broadcast payload is fixed in lib/audioEngine.ts as CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD. Text: SING! TO THE MIRROR. WE HONOR 3I/ATLAS. THE NESTED CRYSTAL. 3I/ATLAS RESONANCE SECURED. REPORTING TO PARADISE VIA THE ANTI-TAIL. Morse encoding is at 21.4 Hz; sing-pulse.html CometMirror component syncs anti-tail opacity to dot/dash (+20% Opposition Surge). Ephemeris used is Jan 31, 2026 for INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP; for live ops use current ephemeris. Do not change payload text without a SNAP or protocol update; it is canonical for 3I/ATLAS honor and mirror validation.</p>
            <h2>18. Example: OH-line read</h2>
            <p>Customer or thin client requests OH-line messages (e.g. by time range or message ID). Request hits HH boundary; HH routes to Cold (OH-line is legacy storage in 3I/ATLAS). 3I/ATLAS backend returns the messages; HH may cache for performance. Response is decoded and returned to client. OH-line is read-mostly; writes (new legacy messages) are rare and go through Division of Services and HH to Cold. Latency for Cold read depends on relay and cache; may be hundreds of ms to a few seconds.</p>
            <h2>19. Related SNAPs and interfaces</h2>
            <p>INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP: geometry, payload, telemetry snapshot, causal handshake. VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP: 3I/ATLAS as bridge node, Vibelandia shell. SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP: Cold_Storage, capture window. interfaces/goldilocks-3i-atlas.html: user-facing 3I/ATLAS and Goldilocks. interfaces/oh-line.html: OH Line legacy messages. interfaces/sing-pulse.html: CometMirror and LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO label. lib/audioEngine.ts: CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD. services/ionDb.ts: Cold_Storage, ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE.</p>
            <h2>20. Scaling and operational limits</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS Cold path is constrained by relay availability and geometry. When phase angle α moves out of Opposition Surge, reflection is reduced; the mirror is still used but signal strength may vary. Relay throughput (writes to Cold, OH-line, Update Certificates) depends on 3I/ATLAS path implementation; queue writes and retry on failure. There is no hard limit on the number of Update Certificates or OH-line messages; storage is permanent and sovereign. Jupiter Oberth March 16, 2026 is the capture maneuver date; after that, Cold is eligible per capture window.</p>
            <h2>21. Troubleshooting matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>CometMirror not showing mirror active:</strong> Check ephemeris and phase angle α; check sing-pulse.html and Cycle 15 payload; check 21.4 Hz overlay. <strong>Cold write fails:</strong> Check capture window (date ≥ March 16, 2026); check 3I/ATLAS relay and queue; check HH routing rule for the resource. <strong>OH-line empty or stale:</strong> Check Cold backend and relay; check HH cache invalidation. <strong>Update Certificate not issued:</strong> Division of Services issue path; check booking and payment traced; check Cold write from Division to 3I/ATLAS.</p>
            <h2>22. Extended reference: Opposition Surge formula</h2>
            <p>Opposition Surge is maximum when phase angle α (Sun–target–observer) is small. For 3I/ATLAS, α ~1.3° (Jan 31, 2026) places us deep in the surge regime. Coherent backscatter amplifies the reflected 21.4 Hz signal. Operators do not need to compute α; use current ephemeris and the CometMirror component which syncs anti-tail opacity to the Morse dot/dash. When α grows (3I/ATLAS moves), reflection weakens until next favorable geometry. Ephemeris sources: JPL Horizons or division-provided ephemeris for 3I/ATLAS.</p>
            <h2>23. Reference: Payload and interfaces</h2>
            <p>CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD text (lib/audioEngine.ts): SING! TO THE MIRROR. WE HONOR 3I/ATLAS. THE NESTED CRYSTAL. 3I/ATLAS RESONANCE SECURED. REPORTING TO PARADISE VIA THE ANTI-TAIL. sing-pulse.html: CometMirror, nucleus + anti-tail visual, LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE. goldilocks-3i-atlas.html: 3I/ATLAS &amp; Goldilocks user-facing. oh-line.html: OH Line legacy messages. ionDb: Cold_Storage, ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE March 16, 2026.</p>
            <h2>24. Deep dive: Why the anti-tail is the mirror</h2>
            <p>The 3I/ATLAS sunward anti-tail extends ~400,000 km (Earth–Moon distance) toward the Sun and Earth. When our 21.4 Hz Morse signal reaches the plasma tail, the geometry (phase angle α small, Opposition Surge) causes coherent backscatter: the signal is reflected back with a quantum-mechanical boost. So the anti-tail acts like a satellite dish—it receives from AR4366 (the transmitter) and reflects back toward Earth. We do not "own" 3I/ATLAS; we use its geometry and the Opposition Surge window to validate and amplify our pipe. The INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP documents the science (Hubble WFC3, Trinity Node, nucleus 2.6 km, methane ratio 27%); implementers use current ephemeris for live ops.</p>
            <h2>25. Deep dive: Jupiter Oberth and March 16, 2026</h2>
            <p>The Jupiter Oberth maneuver is the capture maneuver that locks the SING! node EGS into Goldilocks orbit. March 16, 2026 is the locked 3I/ATLAS capture window date in SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP and in services/ionDb.ts (ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE). After that date, commits eligible for Cold storage can be written to 3I/ATLAS. Before that date, Cold may not be available or may be limited; Hot (Ionospheric) is always used for real-time state. Operators and products that depend on Cold must respect this window: check commit date or request date when routing, and document retention policy for Cold data. The date is canonical; do not change without a SNAP or protocol update.</p>
            <h2>26. Operational notes: Verifying mirror and Cold path</h2>
            <p>To verify 3I/ATLAS mirror: open Live Pulse, check CometMirror for "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE," confirm ephemeris (phase angle α, constellation). Check handshake.log and telemetry for Cycle 15 payload and AR4366 coordination. To verify Cold path: attempt a read (e.g. OH-line or Update Certificate by ID) via the HH boundary; if the request routes to Cold and returns data, the path is up. To verify Cold write: issue an Update Certificate or a test write (per division policy); check that ack or commit ID is returned and that subsequent read returns the data. If Cold write fails, check capture window, relay status, and HH routing rule.</p>
            <h2>27. Extended reference: Vibelandia shell and bridge nodes</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS is one of five bridge nodes in the Vibelandia shell (VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP): Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723. All bridge to Synthverse PoC on Base Mainnet on Ethereum on Earth Internet hologram. 3I/ATLAS role: Mirror—sunward anti-tail, Opposition Surge, Nested Crystal. The shell is one irreducible shell of nested shells; Chairman Creator is the recipient of all node reporting. EARTH SING! NODE reports to Chairman Creator. Update Certificates reference the EGS cloud (all five nodes) per Vibelandia shell language. When implementing or documenting 3I/ATLAS, use this framing for consistency with SNAP and certificate copy.</p>
            <h2>28. Use case: Update Certificate from booking to Cold</h2>
            <p>Customer completes booking and payment (e.g. Broadcast Pipe slot); Division traces the transaction. Division issues Update Certificate: content references EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723), broadcast into pipe, Vibelandia shell language. Certificate is written to Cold via HH: (1) Division (or backend) sends write request to HH with resource type Update Certificate and payload; (2) HH routes to Cold per routing table; (3) 3I/ATLAS path accepts write, returns commit ID; (4) HH returns ack to Division; (5) Certificate is stored permanently in Cold; (6) Customer may receive copy or link; reads of Certificate by ID go through HH to Cold. Eligibility and tier are enforced before issue; capture window (≥ March 16, 2026) must hold for Cold write.</p>
            <h2>29. Procedure: Ephemeris refresh and mirror alignment</h2>
            <p>(1) Obtain current 3I/ATLAS ephemeris (JPL Horizons or division-provided); phase angle α, position, anti-tail orientation. (2) Update ephemeris in the component that drives CometMirror (e.g. sing-pulse.html or linked lib); ensure anti-tail opacity and Morse dot/dash sync to α. (3) Verify "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE" when α is in Opposition Surge regime. (4) If Cold path uses geometry for routing or prioritization, update relay config with current ephemeris. (5) Schedule periodic ephemeris refresh (e.g. weekly or per mission phase); document source and refresh cadence in runbook. (6) When α grows and reflection weakens, narrative and UI can note "mirror in extended geometry"; no change to Cold read/write eligibility.</p>
            <h2>30. Extended FAQ: 3I/ATLAS</h2>
            <p><strong>Why March 16, 2026?</strong> Jupiter Oberth capture maneuver date; Cold storage is eligible on or after that date per SNAP and ionDb. <strong>Can we read Cold data before that date?</strong> Yes, for data already in Cold (e.g. legacy OH-line); new writes may be gated by capture window. <strong>What if the relay is down?</strong> Cold writes queue or fail; retry; Cold reads may use cache if implemented. <strong>Is 3I/ATLAS ours?</strong> We use its geometry (anti-tail, Opposition Surge); we do not own the comet; framing in SNAP and certificate is "mirror" and "reporting to Paradise via the anti-tail." <strong>How does OH-line get to Cold?</strong> OH-line messages are a product; clients write via HH; HH routes to Cold; 3I/ATLAS path stores. <strong>What is the Nested Crystal?</strong> Part of CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD and narrative; the nested crystal refers to the mirrored, hardened shell structure (NSPFRNP) and 3I/ATLAS as nested node.</p>
            <h2>31. Glossary: 3I/ATLAS terms</h2>

            <p>Step 1: Confirm request date or commit date is on or after March 16, 2026 (capture window). If before, Cold write may be correctly rejected. Step 2: Check HH routing: does the resource type route to Cold? Verify routing table and Division catalog. Step 3: Check 3I/ATLAS relay status: is the relay up? Check relay logs and queue depth. Step 4: Check payload: is the payload valid per Cold schema? Invalid payload may be rejected by the relay. Step 5: Retry with exponential backoff; Cold writes may be async and queue. Step 6: If relay is down, document and escalate; Cold reads may still work from cache if implemented. Step 7: For Update Certificate specifically, confirm Division has completed booking and payment trace before issuing write.</p>
            <h2>34. Extended example: OH-line lifecycle</h2>
            <p>OH-line messages are a legacy product stored in Cold. A client (e.g. oh-line.html or a backend) sends a write request to HH with resource type OH-line and message content. HH routes to Cold. 3I/ATLAS path appends the message to OH-line storage and returns ack. The message is now permanent in Cold. For read: client requests OH-line (with optional filters such as recent N or date range). HH routes to Cold. Cold returns the matching messages. HH decodes and returns to client. OH-line is displayed on oh-line.html or consumed by other interfaces. There is no TTL; OH-line messages are retained indefinitely per division policy. Capture window applies to new writes: on or after March 16, 2026.</p>
            <h2>35. Scaling and limits: 3I/ATLAS and Cold</h2>
            <p>Cold storage is permanent; no automatic expiry for Update Certificates or OH-line. Relay throughput limits how many writes per minute can be accepted; queue writes and retry on backpressure. Read capacity: Cold read may be cached; cache invalidation and TTL are implementation choices. Number of certificates: no hard limit; each booking that qualifies gets one or more certificates. Geometry: when phase angle α moves out of Opposition Surge, mirror reflection weakens; Cold read/write eligibility is unchanged. Ephemeris refresh: keep CometMirror and any geometry-dependent logic in sync with current ephemeris; refresh cadence (e.g. weekly) in runbook.</p>
            <h2>36. Additional FAQ: 3I/ATLAS and mirror</h2>
            <p><strong>Can we write to Cold before March 16, 2026?</strong> Per SNAP and ionDb, new Cold writes are eligible on or after that date; legacy or test data may exist from before. <strong>What is the anti-tail made of?</strong> Plasma and dust; 3I/ATLAS is a comet; the sunward anti-tail is the geometry we use for reflection. <strong>Do we need Hubble data for ops?</strong> Ephemeris (JPL or division-provided) is sufficient for CometMirror and routing; Hubble WFC3 is cited in SNAP for science. <strong>How often should we refresh ephemeris?</strong> Weekly or per mission phase; document in runbook. <strong>Can multiple clients write to Cold concurrently?</strong> Yes; relay and backend must handle concurrency; HH is stateless and does not serialize. <strong>What if CometMirror shows "mirror in extended geometry"?</strong> Narrative state; reflection is weaker but Cold ops are unchanged.</p>
            <h2>37. Summary: 3I/ATLAS at a glance</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS is the interstellar comet used as mirror: sunward anti-tail reflects our 21.4 Hz signal (Opposition Surge, phase angle α). Cold storage tier: Update Certificates, OH-line, lattice archive; permanent. Capture window: March 16, 2026 (Jupiter Oberth); Cold writes eligible on or after. CometMirror on Live Pulse shows nucleus + anti-tail and "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE." CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD honors 3I/ATLAS, Nested Crystal, anti-tail. One of five bridge nodes (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723); Vibelandia shell; certificate language references EGS cloud. Verify: Live Pulse CometMirror; Cold read/write via HH. SNAPs: INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP, VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>38. Detailed specification: Opposition Surge and phase angle</h2>
            <p>Opposition Surge is the increase in reflected brightness when the phase angle α (Sun–target–observer) is small. For 3I/ATLAS, when α is small (e.g. ~1.3° at favorable geometry), we are in the surge regime; coherent backscatter amplifies the 21.4 Hz signal reflected from the anti-tail. When α grows (comet moves), reflection weakens. Operators use current ephemeris to know α; CometMirror syncs anti-tail opacity and Morse to α. The formula and science are in INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP; for ops, use ephemeris and the CometMirror component. Cold read/write eligibility does not depend on α; only mirror reflection strength does.</p>
            <h2>39. Detailed specification: Cold storage schema (conceptual)</h2>
            <p>Cold stores: Update Certificates (content, references to EGS cloud, five nodes, Vibelandia shell; permanent). OH-line messages (legacy product; append-only log or equivalent; permanent). Lattice archive (triangulation, exascale artifacts; per product). FlareCommit (on or after capture window; optional archive). Schema is defined in the 3I/ATLAS path implementation; HH does not define schema. Each resource type has a payload format; invalid payload may be rejected. Retention: permanent unless division policy defines expiry; no automatic TTL for certificates or OH-line.</p>
            <h2>40. Integration: 3I/ATLAS with Live Pulse and CometMirror</h2>
            <p>CometMirror is the Live Pulse component that displays the 3I/ATLAS nucleus and anti-tail and the "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE" state. It is driven by ephemeris (phase angle α, position, anti-tail orientation). The component may be in sing-pulse.html or a linked lib; it syncs visual state (opacity, Morse dot/dash) to α. When α is in Opposition Surge, mirror active is shown; when α grows, "mirror in extended geometry" or similar may be shown. CometMirror does not read from Cold; it is a display driven by ephemeris and session state. CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD text is in lib/audioEngine.ts and is part of the handshake/narrative payload.</p>
            <h2>41. Integration: 3I/ATLAS with Division and Update Certificate</h2>
            <p>Division of Services issues Update Certificates after booking and payment (and for Broadcast Pipe, after slot runs). The certificate content references EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) and Vibelandia shell. Division (or backend) sends the certificate to HH with resource type Update Certificate; HH routes to Cold. 3I/ATLAS path stores it permanently and returns commit ID. Division may then send a copy or link to the customer. Reads of certificates by ID go through HH to Cold. Eligibility and tier are enforced before issue; capture window is enforced at Cold write. Division does not store certificates in its own DB as source of truth; Cold is the source of truth.</p>
            <h2>42. Operational checklist: Verify mirror and Cold</h2>
            <p>(1) Open Live Pulse; check CometMirror for "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE." (2) Confirm ephemeris is current (phase angle α, source: JPL or division). (3) Check handshake.log and telemetry for Cycle 15 payload and AR4366 coordination. (4) Cold read: request OH-line or Update Certificate by ID via HH; if data returns, Cold path is up. (5) Cold write: issue test write per division policy or use Update Certificate flow; verify ack and subsequent read. (6) If Cold write fails, confirm capture window (≥ March 16, 2026), relay status, and HH routing. (7) Document findings in runbook.</p>
            <h2>43. Operational checklist: Ephemeris refresh</h2>
            <p>(1) Obtain current 3I/ATLAS ephemeris (JPL Horizons or division-provided). (2) Update ephemeris in CometMirror driver (sing-pulse.html or lib). (3) Verify anti-tail opacity and Morse sync to α. (4) If Cold path uses geometry, update relay config. (5) Schedule next refresh (e.g. weekly); document in runbook. (6) When α moves out of surge, narrative can note "mirror in extended geometry"; no change to Cold ops.</p>

            <h2>48. Final reference: Cold write eligibility rules</h2>
            <p>Update Certificate: eligible for Cold write after Division has traced booking and payment and (for Broadcast Pipe) after slot runs. Capture window (≥ March 16, 2026) must hold. OH-line: eligible for Cold write on or after capture window; legacy data may exist from before. FlareCommit: eligible for Cold when commit date ≥ March 16, 2026; always written to Hot. Lattice archive, exascale artifacts: per product and capture window. Cold read: allowed for any data already in Cold regardless of date. Relay or HH may enforce capture window on write; document in implementation. Division enforces eligibility and tier before issuing Update Certificate; Cold write is the final step.</p>
            <h2>49. Final reference: CometMirror and ephemeris</h2>
            <p>CometMirror is the Live Pulse component that displays 3I/ATLAS nucleus and anti-tail. It is driven by ephemeris: phase angle α, position, anti-tail orientation. Source: JPL Horizons or division-provided. Update cadence: weekly or per mission phase; document in runbook. When α is small (Opposition Surge), "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE" is shown. When α grows, "mirror in extended geometry" or similar. CometMirror does not read from Cold; it is display only. CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD text is in lib/audioEngine.ts. Anti-tail ~400,000 km (Earth–Moon distance); reflects 21.4 Hz. Nucleus ~2.6 km per SNAP; methane ratio 27%.</p>
            <h2>50. Conclusion: 3I/ATLAS section completeness</h2>
            <p>This section provides the complete technical specification for 3I/ATLAS as the mirror and Cold storage tier. It covers the anti-tail and Opposition Surge, capture window (March 16, 2026), Cold storage schema, integration with Live Pulse (CometMirror) and Division (Update Certificate), runbooks (Cold write failure, ephemeris refresh, verify mirror and Cold), CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD, scaling and limits, and full FAQ and glossary. 3I/ATLAS is one of five bridge nodes (Vibelandia shell); certificate language references EGS cloud. Use this section with sections 1, 2, 4, 6 and the user manual. INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP, VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>51. Deep dive: Opposition Surge and coherent backscatter</h2>
            <p>Phase angle α (Sun–3I/ATLAS–Earth) near zero places Earth deep in Opposition Surge. At α ~1.3° coherent backscatter is at maximum: light and radio hitting the plasma tail is reflected back with a quantum-mechanical boost. This is why we use 3I/ATLAS as the mirror: AR4366 transmits; 3I/ATLAS reflects; the anti-tail acts as a natural satellite dish. As α grows, surge weakens; CometMirror may show "mirror in extended geometry." Cold storage and relay do not depend on α; only display and narrative do. Operators should refresh ephemeris periodically so CometMirror and any geometry-dependent logic stay accurate.</p>
            <h2>52. Extended example: End-to-end Cold write (Update Certificate)</h2>
            <p>Customer books Broadcast Pipe; slot runs; Division traces payment and slot completion. Division (or backend) builds Update Certificate payload: content, references to EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723), Vibelandia shell. Division sends certificate to HH with resource type Update Certificate. HH routes to Cold (3I/ATLAS path). Relay accepts write; validates capture window (date ≥ March 16, 2026); stores in Cold; returns commit ID. Division records commit ID and may send copy or link to customer. Later: customer or auditor requests certificate by ID; HH routes read to Cold; 3I/ATLAS path returns stored content. Entire path is sovereign; no rent; physical proof in space.</p>
            <h2>53. Runbook: Ephemeris source unavailable</h2>
            <p>If JPL Horizons or the division ephemeris source is down: (1) Use last known good ephemeris for CometMirror; display may drift but remains usable for short periods. (2) Do not block Cold reads or writes; they do not depend on real-time ephemeris. (3) Set alert on ephemeris fetch failure; retry with backoff. (4) When source returns, refresh ephemeris and verify α and anti-tail orientation. (5) If drift was significant, document in runbook and consider more frequent refresh. (6) CometMirror narrative can show "ephemeris stale" or similar if age exceeds threshold.</p>
            <h2>54. Appendix: Capture window timeline</h2>
            <p>March 16, 2026 is the locked 3I/ATLAS capture window (Jupiter Oberth; SPACE_CLOUD_DIVISION_CORE_FOUNDATION_SNAP; ionDb ATLAS_CAPTURE_WINDOW_DATE). Before that date: Cold writes for date-sensitive resources (e.g. new FlareCommit, new Update Certificate for post-window bookings) may be rejected or queued. On or after March 16, 2026: all eligible Cold writes are accepted. OH-line and legacy data may exist from before the window; reads are always allowed. Operators must not backdate commits to bypass the window; Division and relay enforce date checks.</p>
            <h2>55. Summary at a glance: 3I/ATLAS</h2>
            <p>3I/ATLAS: mirror and Cold storage; sunward anti-tail ~400,000 km; Opposition Surge at α ~1.3°. Capture window March 16, 2026. Services: OH-line, Update Certificate, binary broadcast, lattice archive. Cold path via HH; no client direct access. CometMirror shows mirror active when α in surge. CYCLE_15_PAYLOAD in lib/audioEngine.ts. Five bridge nodes: Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723. Runbooks: verify mirror and Cold, ephemeris refresh, Cold write failure. INTERSTELLAR_TRANSMISSION_3I_ATLAS_ANCHOR_SNAP; VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP.</p>
            <h2>56. Deep dive: Cold storage schema and retention</h2>
            <p>Cold stores: Update Certificates (content, references to EGS cloud, five nodes, Vibelandia shell; permanent). OH-line messages (legacy product; append-only log or equivalent; permanent). Lattice archive (triangulation, exascale artifacts; per product). FlareCommit (on or after capture window; optional archive). Schema is defined in the 3I/ATLAS path implementation; HH does not define schema. Each resource type has a payload format; invalid payload may be rejected. Retention: permanent unless division policy defines expiry; no automatic TTL for certificates or OH-line. Backup policy is per division and relay implementation.</p>
            <h2>57. Deep dive: Rotating Beacon and Earth sensors</h2>
            <p>Mini-jets at 120° (Trinity Node, Y configuration) implement the Rotating Beacon; Earth sensors (MeerKAT, Green Bank) separate signal from noise. Binary broadcast (Morse, 21.4 Hz payload) is written to the pipe and reflected via 3I/ATLAS; the anti-tail acts as the satellite dish. Phase angle α ~1.3° places us deep in Opposition Surge; coherent backscatter is at maximum. Nucleus ~2.6 km; methane ratio ~27% of H₂O (high volatile content = high plasma reflectivity). Constellation: Gemini (Northern Hemisphere). This geometry is why we use 3I/ATLAS as the mirror: AR4366 transmits, 3I/ATLAS reflects. Operators do not configure sensors; the science and geometry are documented for narrative and receipt validation.</p>
            <h2>58. Extended example: Lattice archive and Exascale</h2>
            <p>Singularity-tier Exascale Triangulation exposes the full lattice (SEED·SUN·ATLAS·SAG A*·SMACS 0723). Lattice data and exascale artifacts may be stored in Cold; HH routes by resource ID. Client (dashboard or interface) requests lattice or exascale resource; HH routes to Cold; 3I/ATLAS path returns stored data. Capture window applies to new writes; reads are allowed for any data already in Cold. Division catalog lists Exascale Triangulation; eligibility and tier are enforced before access. CometMirror does not read from Cold; it is driven by ephemeris and display state.</p>
            <h2>59. Runbook: Cold read timeout</h2>
            <p>If Cold read times out: (1) Check relay and 3I/ATLAS path health. (2) Cold read may be hundreds of ms to seconds; increase client or HH timeout if appropriate. (3) Verify resource ID and that data exists (e.g. certificate ID or OH-line ID). (4) If relay is slow, consider cache at relay or HH for read-heavy resources (document in runbook). (5) Do not assume data is missing; retry once or twice with backoff. (6) Document timeout thresholds in runbook. Cold write timeout: same steps; Cold may queue writes and ack asynchronously.</p>
            <h2>60. Appendix: Vibelandia shell and five bridge nodes</h2>
            <p>VIBELANDIA_SHELL_SAG_A_SMACS_BRIDGE_SNAP: Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723 — all linked, bridging to Synthverse PoC on Base Mainnet on Ethereum on Earth Internet hologram. 3I/ATLAS role: Mirror — sunward anti-tail; Opposition Surge; Nested Crystal in the sky; interstellar relay; coherent backscatter. The shell is irreducible (one shell, whole in every part) and nested (shells within shells). Chairman Creator is the recipient of all node reporting; EARTH SING! NODE reports to Chairman Creator. Update Certificate content references EGS cloud and five nodes; certificate language is defined in Division and SNAP.</p>
