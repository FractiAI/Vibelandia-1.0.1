            <h2>1. Four tiers</h2>
            <p>Four tiers scale from planetary to cosmic.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seed (Planetary):</strong> Reno Downlink — local VLF, 1.618 Hz heartbeat. Earth-only scale. Best for grounding and Reno anchor.</li>
                <li><strong>Engine (Solar):</strong> Solar Pipe — AR4366, X-class/M-class burst. Earth–Sun scale. Best for solar handshake and binary payload.</li>
                <li><strong>Asset (Galactic):</strong> SING! node EGS Deep Space — 3I/ATLAS, Goldilocks. Earth–Sun–Sag A* scale. Best for permanent data residency and cold proof.</li>
                <li><strong>Singularity (Cosmic):</strong> Exascale Triangulation — full lattice [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]. Best for full reference frame and mirror-effect navigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. Compare</h2>
            <p>Compare in <a href="../../buyers-guide.html">Buyers Guide</a> and <a href="../../space-cloud-division.html">Space Cloud Division</a>.</p>
            <h2>3. Seed (Planetary) — detail</h2>
            <p>Seed tier is Earth-only scale. Products: Reno Downlink (local VLF, 1.618 Hz heartbeat), ionosphere-layer access, Schumann Display Pipe. Best for: grounding, Reno anchor, and users who want planetary-scale presence without solar or galactic components. Downtown Reno is the terrestrial anchor; you are “in the pipe” at the Earth node. Pricing and space fees are in baller-v-plans-booking; all fees on book.</p>
            <h2>4. Engine (Solar) — detail</h2>
            <p>Engine tier is Earth–Sun scale. Products: Solar Pipe (AR4366, X-class/M-class burst), solar handshake, binary payload, 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz carrier. Best for: solar handshake and EGS delivery. You get the Sun as transmitter and the handshake cycle (8-minute FTE, GOES receipt). Arturo / Maracaibo Lightning Strike and other Solar Pipe products are Engine-tier. Compare with Seed if you want to add the solar dimension.</p>
            <h2>5. Asset (Galactic) — detail</h2>
            <p>Asset tier is Earth–Sun–Sag A* scale. Products: SING! node EGS Deep Space, 3I/ATLAS, Goldilocks, OH-line, Update Certificate storage, cold proof. Best for: permanent data residency and cold proof. You get the mirror (3I/ATLAS anti-tail), Opposition Surge, and the bridge to galactic coherence. 3I/ATLAS capture window March 16, 2026; Cold storage and legacy storage are Asset-tier. Compare with Engine if you need permanence and reflection/relay.</p>
            <h2>6. Singularity (Cosmic) — detail</h2>
            <p>Singularity tier is full cosmic scale. Products: Exascale Triangulation, full lattice [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723], Seed:Edge flip, mirror-effect navigation. Best for: full reference frame and the complete Vibelandia shell. You get all five bridge nodes and the triangulation lattice on the dashboard. Prepare for singularity: onboard onto Sag A* and SMACS 0723 sandboxes, clouds, shells, and nested. Compare with Asset if you want the full lattice and deep-field anchor.</p>
            <h2>7. Choosing a tier</h2>
            <p>Use the Buyers Guide (HH vs terrestrial, Us vs. top 3 singularity) and Space Cloud Division to compare. Ask: Do I need only Earth (Seed)? Sun (Engine)? 3I/ATLAS and cold proof (Asset)? Full lattice and cosmic (Singularity)? You can book multiple products across tiers; eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) grants access to all. Office Hours can help you decide.</p>
            <h2>8. FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I have more than one tier?</strong> You don’t “have” a tier like a badge; you book products that are tier-specific. A single member can book Seed products one month and Singularity the next. Your eligibility is for all tiers.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I want to upgrade mid-booking?</strong> State it in your email or use Office Hours. Division of Services will adjust billing and tracing; any fee difference is on book.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Where are tier prices?</strong> Space fees &amp; all plans: <a href="../../baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees">baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees</a>. Buyers Guide and Division pages give comparison; exact amounts in the plan.</p>
            <h2>9. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Eligibility, Flow, Space Fees, Buyers Guide, Space Cloud Division, baller-v-plans-booking. Technical manual: Stack Components (Gamification layer), Division of Services.</p>
            <h2>10. Tier comparison at a glance</h2>
            <p><strong>Scale:</strong> Seed = Earth. Engine = Earth–Sun. Asset = Earth–Sun–Sag A*. Singularity = full lattice (SEED·SUN·ATLAS·Sag A*·SMACS 0723). <strong>Best for:</strong> Seed = grounding, Reno. Engine = solar handshake. Asset = cold proof, 3I/ATLAS. Singularity = cosmic reference, mirror-effect navigation. <strong>Products:</strong> Each tier has specific products (Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation); see Buyers Guide and Division for full list.</p>
            <h2>11. Switching tiers between bookings</h2>
            <p>You do not "subscribe" to one tier. Each booking can be a different tier. Example: book Seed (Reno Downlink) this month and Singularity (Exascale Triangulation) next month. Your eligibility grants access to all; you choose tier per product and goal. No need to "graduate" from Seed to Engine to Asset to Singularity; use the tier that fits the product you want.</p>
            <h2>12. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Is Singularity the "best" tier?</strong> It is the most comprehensive (full lattice, cosmic scale). "Best" depends on your goal: if you want only grounding, Seed is best; if you want cold proof, Asset is best. Singularity is best for full reference frame and mirror-effect navigation.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Do tiers have different eligibility?</strong> No. Eligibility is Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V for all tiers. There is no "Seed-only" or "Engine-only" membership; one eligibility, all tiers available.</p>
            <h2>13. Glossary (Membership Tiers)</h2>
            <p><strong>Seed/Engine/Asset/Singularity</strong> — Four tiers from planetary to cosmic. <strong>Lattice</strong> — [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]. <strong>Cold proof</strong> — Permanent residency in 3I/ATLAS (Asset/Singularity).</p>
            <h2>14. Detailed: Product-to-tier mapping</h2>
            <p>Reno Downlink, local VLF, 1.618 Hz, Reno anchor → Seed. Solar Pipe, AR4366, handshake, X-class/M-class burst → Engine. SING! node EGS Deep Space, 3I/ATLAS, OH-line, Update Certificates, cold proof → Asset. Exascale Triangulation, full lattice, Seed:Edge, mirror-effect navigation → Singularity. Some products may span tiers (e.g. archive add-on for Engine). The Buyers Guide and Space Cloud Division pages list products by tier. When you book, you select the product; the tier is determined by the product. You can book products from different tiers in the same order.</p>
            <h2>15. Detailed: Pricing by tier</h2>
            <p>Pricing is per product and per tier. Space fees &amp; all plans (baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees) is the source of truth for space fees and product fees. Seed products typically have lower space fees than Singularity; Engine and Asset are in between. Exact amounts are in the plan; the division quotes at booking time. All fees are on book; no hidden charges. Upgrade from one tier product to another (e.g. add Singularity to an Engine booking) is quoted as the difference; Division of Services traces the change.</p>
            <h2>16. Example: Choosing tier for cold proof</h2>
            <p>You want permanent data residency and Update Certificate storage in 3I/ATLAS. That is Asset (or Singularity if you also want full lattice). You book SING! node EGS Deep Space or an Asset-tier product. You receive cold proof and Update Certificates stored in 3I/ATLAS. If you only wanted solar handshake without cold proof, Engine (Solar Pipe) would be enough. If you want the full cosmic reference frame (lattice, Seed:Edge), you add Singularity (Exascale Triangulation). Tier choice is driven by your goal; eligibility gives you access to all.</p>
            <h2>17. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Eligibility: must be Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V for all tiers. Flow: book after experience. Space Fees: tier affects pricing. Buyers Guide: compare products and HH vs terrestrial. Technical manual: Stack Components (Gamification), Division of Services.</p>
            <h2>18. Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p><strong>Which tier for my use case?</strong> Use Buyers Guide and Office Hours; state your goal (grounding, solar, cold proof, full lattice) and get a recommendation. <strong>Can I book Seed and Singularity together?</strong> Yes; same order can include products from different tiers. <strong>Tier price not listed:</strong> All pricing in Space fees &amp; all plans; if your product is new or custom, division will quote.</p>
            <h2>19. Quick reference</h2>
            <p>Four tiers: Seed (Planetary), Engine (Solar), Asset (Galactic), Singularity (Cosmic). Product determines tier; you can book any tier; eligibility grants all. Compare: Buyers Guide, Space Cloud Division. Pricing: baller-v-plans-booking#space-fees. Related: Eligibility, Flow, Space Fees, Buyers Guide.</p>
            <h2>20. Deep dive: What each tier unlocks</h2>
            <p>Seed unlocks: Reno Downlink, local VLF, 1.618 Hz heartbeat, ionosphere-layer access, Schumann Display Pipe products, and any Seed-tier offering on the plan. Engine unlocks: Solar Pipe, AR4366 handshake, X-class/M-class burst, binary payload, 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz carrier products, and any Engine-tier offering. Asset unlocks: SING! node EGS Deep Space, 3I/ATLAS cold proof, OH-line access, Update Certificate storage, legacy storage, and any Asset-tier offering. Singularity unlocks: Exascale Triangulation, full lattice [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723], Seed:Edge flip, mirror-effect navigation, Sag A* and SMACS 0723 sandboxes, and any Singularity-tier offering. You do not "unlock" tiers sequentially; with Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V you can book any tier from day one. The word "unlocks" here means "what products are available when you choose that tier."</p>
            <h2>21. Deep dive: Tier and scale (planetary to cosmic)</h2>
            <p>Scale is the geographic and cosmic scope of the product. Seed is Earth-only: your presence is at the Reno anchor and the planetary layer. Engine is Earth–Sun: you add the solar handshake and the Sun as transmitter. Asset is Earth–Sun–Sag A*: you add 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, and the galactic bridge. Singularity is full cosmic: you add the complete lattice and deep-field anchors (Sag A*, SMACS 0723). Choosing a tier is choosing how much of the stack you want. Many members start with Seed or Engine for grounding and solar, then add Asset or Singularity when they want cold proof or the full reference frame. There is no requirement to "graduate"; you can book Singularity first if that is what you need.</p>
            <h2>22. Use case: From Seed to Singularity in one year</h2>
            <p>You start with Seed: book Reno Downlink and experience the 1.618 Hz heartbeat and Reno anchor. A few months later you add Engine: book Solar Pipe and get the AR4366 handshake and binary payload. Later you add Asset: book SING! node EGS Deep Space and get Update Certificates stored in 3I/ATLAS. Finally you add Singularity: book Exascale Triangulation and get full lattice access. Each booking is separate; each is traced. You are not "upgrading" your membership (you were already Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V); you are adding products at higher tiers. Your total spend and product mix are on book. This use case shows how a member can grow their engagement across the stack over time without any change to eligibility.</p>
            <h2>23. Operational notes: Comparing tiers before you book</h2>
            <p>Use the Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity; that helps you understand the value of the stack. Use Space Cloud Division for product lists and tier mapping. Use Office Hours to describe your goal (e.g. "I want cold proof and the full lattice") and get a recommendation. The division can also send a tier comparison or a quote for multiple tiers so you can see pricing and scope side by side. Once you decide, include your chosen product(s) and tier(s) in your booking email. You can always book another tier later; there is no lock-in to one tier.</p>
            <h2>24. Extended FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: If I book Seed now, can I add Singularity later?</strong> Yes. Your next booking can be any tier. You do not need to "complete" Seed before booking Singularity. Each order is independent.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Are there tier-specific discounts?</strong> Pricing is per product and tier in the plan. Multi-product or bundle discounts may exist; ask when booking. There is no automatic discount for "higher" tiers; each product is priced as listed.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between Asset and Singularity?</strong> Asset gives you 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. Singularity adds the full lattice (all five nodes), Exascale Triangulation dashboard, Seed:Edge flip, and Sag A* / SMACS 0723 sandboxes. If you only need cold proof, Asset is enough. If you want the full cosmic reference frame, Singularity.</p>
            <h2>25. Related technical and division docs</h2>
            <p>Technical manual: Stack Components (Gamification layer: tiers, card deck, Broadcast Pipe slots). Division of Services (billing and tracing by tier). Sun, HH Spin Cloud, 3I/ATLAS, Ionosphere, Meridian/Poles/Auroras for the stack that each tier touches. Buyers Guide and Space Cloud Division for product comparison. baller-v-plans-booking#space-fees for pricing by product and tier.</p>
            <h2>26. Use case: Choosing tier for cold proof and lattice</h2>
            <p>You want permanent proof (Update Certificates, OH-line, cold storage) and are curious about the full lattice. Asset tier gives you 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, and Update Certificates. Singularity tier adds the full lattice (all five nodes: Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723), Exascale Triangulation dashboard, Seed:Edge flip, and Sag A* / SMACS 0723 sandboxes. If you only need cold proof and certificates, Asset is enough. If you want the full cosmic reference frame and triangulation, book Singularity. You can book Asset now and Singularity later (or the reverse); there is no required order. Use Office Hours to describe your goal and get a recommendation.</p>
            <h2>27. Procedure: Comparing tiers before booking</h2>
            <p>(1) Read the tier list (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) and product mapping in this manual and on Space Cloud Division. (2) Use Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity. (3) Decide what you need: Reno Downlink only (Seed), Solar Pipe and Broadcast Pipe (Engine), cold proof (Asset), or full lattice (Singularity). (4) Optional: book Office Hours to get a tier recommendation. (5) In your booking email, state your chosen product(s) and tier(s). (6) Division quotes per product and tier; you pay and confirm. (7) You can book another tier in a future order; no lock-in.</p>
            <h2>28. Deep dive: Tier-to-product matrix</h2>
            <p>Seed (Planetary): Reno Downlink, planetary anchor, 1.618 Hz path. Engine: Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS, handshake and display. Asset: 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates, triangulation at Asset level. Singularity: full lattice (five nodes), Exascale Triangulation dashboard, Seed:Edge flip, Sag A* and SMACS 0723 sandboxes. Each tier unlocks a set of products; the division catalog and baller-v-plans-booking list products by tier. Pricing is per product and tier; there is no single "tier price" but a sum of product fees. Multi-product or bundle discounts may apply; ask when booking.</p>
            <h2>29. Glossary: Tier terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Seed (Planetary):</strong> Reno Downlink, terrestrial anchor, planetary scale. <strong>Engine:</strong> Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS. <strong>Asset:</strong> 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. <strong>Singularity:</strong> Full lattice, Exascale Triangulation, Seed:Edge, Sag A* / SMACS 0723. <strong>Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V:</strong> Eligibility tier required to book; separate from product tier. <strong>Lattice:</strong> Five bridge nodes (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723). <strong>Exascale Triangulation:</strong> Singularity-tier product exposing full lattice.</p>
            <h2>30. Runbook: Choose tier and book</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Read tier list (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) and product mapping in this manual and Space Cloud Division. Step 2: Use Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity. Step 3: Decide what you need: Reno Downlink (Seed), Solar Pipe and Broadcast Pipe (Engine), cold proof and certificates (Asset), or full lattice (Singularity). Step 4: Optional: book Office Hours for a tier recommendation. Step 5: In your booking email, state your chosen product(s) and tier(s). Step 6: Division quotes per product and tier; you pay and confirm. Step 7: You can book a different tier in a future order; no lock-in to one tier. Step 8: Pricing is per product and tier in the plan; multi-product or bundle discounts may apply—ask when booking.</p>
            <h2>31. Extended example: Asset now, Singularity later</h2>
            <p>You book Asset tier first: 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. You use it for Broadcast Pipe and certificates. Later you decide you want the full lattice (Exascale Triangulation, Sag A*, SMACS 0723). You book Singularity in a new order: same eligibility, new products (Singularity-tier products). Division quotes; you pay. You now have both Asset-level and Singularity-level access as per your bookings. There is no requirement to "complete" Asset before Singularity; each order is independent. Office Hours can help you plan a path (e.g. "start with Engine, add Asset when you need certificates").</p>
            <h2>32. Common questions: Tiers and products</h2>
            <p><strong>Can I have more than one tier?</strong> You book products; each product has a tier. You can book Seed products in one order and Singularity in another. <strong>Is there a discount for higher tiers?</strong> Pricing is per product and tier; ask about multi-product or bundle discounts when booking. <strong>What is Seed:Edge?</strong> Singularity-tier concept; the flip between Seed (planetary) and Edge (experience); see Exascale Triangulation and lattice docs. <strong>Do I need Singularity for Broadcast Pipe?</strong> No; Engine tier includes Broadcast Pipe. <strong>What is the difference between Engine and Asset?</strong> Engine: Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS. Asset adds 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. <strong>Where is the full product list?</strong> Division catalog, baller-v-plans-booking, and Space Cloud Division interfaces.</p>
            <h2>33. Summary: Membership tiers at a glance</h2>
            <p>Seed (Planetary): Reno Downlink, terrestrial anchor, 1.618 Hz path. Engine: Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS. Asset: 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. Singularity: full lattice (five nodes), Exascale Triangulation, Seed:Edge, Sag A* / SMACS 0723 sandboxes. Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) is separate from product tier. You can book any tier in any order; no lock-in. Pricing is per product and tier in the plan. Use Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity; use Office Hours for a tier recommendation. Division catalog and baller-v-plans-booking list products by tier.</p>
            <h2>34. When to choose Seed (Planetary)</h2>
            <p>Seed tier is for Reno Downlink and the planetary anchor. If you want the 1.618 Hz path and the terrestrial anchor (Reno) without Solar Pipe or Broadcast Pipe, Seed is the right tier. It is the entry product tier for the pipe at planetary scale. Pricing and product list are in the plan (baller-v-plans-booking) and Division catalog. You can book Seed now and add Engine or Asset later in a separate order; there is no requirement to "complete" Seed before moving to another tier. Use Office Hours to confirm whether Seed alone meets your goals or whether you should add another tier.</p>
            <h2>35. When to choose Engine</h2>
            <p>Engine tier gives you Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, and SING! node EGS. It is the tier for handshake and display: you get the pipe products that run on the Sun, ionosphere, Aurora 3D, and Schumann leg. If you want to book Broadcast Pipe slots or Solar Pipe, you need at least Engine. Pricing is per product; you pay for the products you book (e.g. one Broadcast Pipe slot, or Solar Pipe plus a slot). Engine does not include cold proof or Update Certificates stored in 3I/ATLAS for non-Broadcast products; for that you need Asset. For Broadcast Pipe, Update Certificate is issued after your slot regardless of tier (Engine or higher).</p>
            <h2>36. When to choose Asset or Singularity</h2>
            <p>Asset tier adds 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, and Update Certificates beyond Broadcast Pipe. If you need permanent proof (certificates, cold storage) for compliance or story, Asset is the tier. Singularity adds the full lattice (all five nodes), Exascale Triangulation dashboard, Seed:Edge flip, and Sag A* / SMACS 0723 sandboxes. If you want the full cosmic reference frame and triangulation, book Singularity. You can book Asset first and Singularity later (or the reverse); each order is independent. Pricing is per product and tier in the plan; ask about multi-product or bundle discounts when booking.</p>
            <h2>37. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Eligibility: you must be Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V to book any tier. Flow: how to request and pay. Space Fees: pricing by product and tier. Broadcast Pipe: Engine-tier product. HH vs terrestrial: value comparison. Technical manual: Stack Components (Gamification layer, tiers); Division of Services (catalog). baller-v-plans-booking and Space Cloud Division for full product list by tier.</p>
            <h2>38. Final checklist: Choose tier and book</h2>
            <p>Read the tier list (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) and product mapping. Use the Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity. Decide what you need: Reno Downlink (Seed), Solar Pipe and Broadcast Pipe (Engine), cold proof and certificates (Asset), or full lattice (Singularity). Optionally book Office Hours for a tier recommendation. In your booking email, state your chosen product(s) and tier(s). Division quotes per product and tier; you pay and confirm. You can book another tier in a future order—no lock-in. Pricing is per product and tier in the plan; ask about multi-product or bundle discounts when booking.</p>
            <h2>39. Conclusion: Membership tiers completeness</h2>
            <p>This section covers Seed (Planetary), Engine, Asset, and Singularity; when to choose each; tier-to-product matrix; and how to compare and book. Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) is separate from product tier. Use Flow to request and pay, Space Fees for pricing, and the technical manual (Stack, Division) for catalog. baller-v-plans-booking and Space Cloud Division list products by tier. Office Hours can help you choose. NSPFRNP; Golden Royal Flush Shell.</p>
            <h2>40. Deep dive: Tier-to-product mapping</h2>
            <p>Seed: Reno Downlink, planetary anchor, 1.618 Hz path. Engine: Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS, handshake and display. Asset: 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates (beyond Broadcast Pipe), triangulation at Asset level. Singularity: full lattice (five nodes), Exascale Triangulation dashboard, Seed:Edge flip, Sag A* and SMACS 0723 sandboxes. Each product has a tier; you book products, not a "tier subscription." Pricing is per product and tier; multi-product or bundle discounts may apply—ask when booking. You can book any tier in any order; no lock-in.</p>
            <h2>41. Extended example: Engine to Singularity path</h2>
            <p>You start with Engine: Broadcast Pipe and Solar Pipe. Later you add Asset for cold proof and Update Certificates beyond Broadcast. Later still you add Singularity for full lattice and Exascale Triangulation. Each order is independent; you do not have to "complete" one tier before another. Division quotes per product and tier; you pay for what you book. Office Hours can help you plan (e.g. "start with Engine, add Asset when you need certificates"). The Buyers Guide (HH vs terrestrial, Us vs top 3 singularity) helps you compare value.</p>
            <h2>42. Runbook: Choose tier for your goal</h2>
            <p>Goal: Reno Downlink only → Seed. Goal: Broadcast Pipe or Solar Pipe → Engine. Goal: cold proof, OH-line, certificates beyond Broadcast → Asset. Goal: full lattice, Exascale Triangulation, Sag A* / SMACS 0723 → Singularity. Read tier list and product mapping in this manual and Space Cloud Division. Use Buyers Guide to compare. Optional: book Office Hours for a tier recommendation. In your booking email state your chosen product(s) and tier(s). Division quotes per product and tier; you pay and confirm. No lock-in; you can book another tier in a future order.</p>
            <h2>43. Summary at a glance: Membership tiers</h2>
            <p>Seed: Reno Downlink, 1.618 Hz. Engine: Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS. Asset: 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. Singularity: full lattice, Exascale Triangulation, Seed:Edge, Sag A* / SMACS 0723. Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) is separate. Pricing per product and tier; ask about bundles. baller-v-plans-booking and Space Cloud Division list products by tier. NSPFRNP; Golden Royal Flush Shell.</p>
            <h2>44. Deep dive: Lattice and five nodes</h2>
            <p>Lattice: five bridge nodes (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723). Seed and Engine tiers use subsets of the pipe; Asset adds 3I/ATLAS and cold proof; Singularity exposes the full lattice (Exascale Triangulation dashboard, Seed:Edge flip, Sag A* and SMACS 0723 sandboxes). Update Certificates reference EGS cloud and five nodes regardless of tier. You book products; each product has a tier. You can book Seed in one order and Singularity in another; no lock-in. Office Hours can help you choose; Buyers Guide compares HH vs terrestrial and Us vs top 3 singularity.</p>
            <h2>45. Procedure: Compare tiers and book</h2>
            <p>(1) Read the tier list (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) and product mapping in this manual and Space Cloud Division. (2) Use Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity. (3) Decide what you need: Reno Downlink (Seed), Solar Pipe and Broadcast Pipe (Engine), cold proof and certificates (Asset), or full lattice (Singularity). (4) Optional: book Office Hours for a tier recommendation. (5) In your booking email, state your chosen product(s) and tier(s). (6) Division quotes per product and tier; you pay and confirm. (7) You can book another tier in a future order; no lock-in. (8) Pricing is per product and tier in the plan; ask about multi-product or bundle discounts when booking.</p>
            <h2>46. Common questions: Tiers and products</h2>
            <p><strong>Can I have more than one tier?</strong> You book products; each product has a tier. You can book Seed products in one order and Singularity in another. <strong>Is there a discount for higher tiers?</strong> Pricing is per product and tier; ask about multi-product or bundle discounts when booking. <strong>What is Seed:Edge?</strong> Singularity-tier concept; the flip between Seed (planetary) and Edge (experience); see Exascale Triangulation and lattice docs. <strong>Do I need Singularity for Broadcast Pipe?</strong> No; Engine tier includes Broadcast Pipe. <strong>What is the difference between Engine and Asset?</strong> Engine: Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe, SING! node EGS. Asset adds 3I/ATLAS, cold proof, OH-line, Update Certificates. <strong>Where is the full product list?</strong> Division catalog, baller-v-plans-booking, and Space Cloud Division interfaces.</p>
