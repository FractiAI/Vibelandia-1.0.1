        </section>
        <article>
            <h2>1. Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Space fees for space.</strong> All book includes space fees. Studio fees for studio; campus fees for campus; WINK! fees for WINK!. And so on throughout — on all book.</p>
            <h2>2. Schedule</h2>
            <p>See <a href="../../baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees">Space fees &amp; all plans</a> for the full schedule. No hidden fees; all charges are in the plan and Update Certificate.</p>
            <h2>3. What “on book” means</h2>
            <p>Every charge is on book: it appears in the division’s billing and tracing, in your plan, and on the Update Certificate where applicable. There are no surprise fees or third-party add-ons. Space fees for space, studio fees for studio, campus fees for campus, WINK! fees for WINK! — each product line has a clear fee category. Division of Services (technical manual section 6) maintains the mapping and ensures transparency.</p>
            <h2>4. Space fees for space</h2>
            <p>Any booking that uses the EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, or any celestial/planetary resource includes space fees. The amount depends on tier (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity), product, and scale. The full schedule is in Space fees &amp; all plans. Space fees are separate from studio, campus, or WINK! fees; if your booking includes both (e.g. a Broadcast Pipe slot plus studio time), both appear on book.</p>
            <h2>5. Studio, campus, WINK!</h2>
            <p>Studio fees apply to recording, production, and studio time. Campus fees apply to physical campus use and events. WINK! fees apply to WINK! products. Same rule: all on book, no hidden charges. Division of Services traces and catalogs everything; you see the breakdown before and after payment.</p>
            <h2>6. Update Certificate and proof</h2>
            <p>When your booking includes broadcast or mission-relevant delivery, you receive an Update Certificate. The certificate proves broadcast into the EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) per Vibelandia shell language. Space fees and product fees are reflected in the certificate and in the division’s records. ZENODO DOI and mission verification docs align with Update Certificates where applicable.</p>
            <h2>7. FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Are space fees one-time or recurring?</strong> Depends on the product. Single-slot Broadcast Pipe is one-time; subscriptions or recurring products are defined in the plan. The schedule in Space fees &amp; all plans spells it out.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I get a breakdown before booking?</strong> Yes. Ask in your booking email or in Office Hours. Division of Services can provide a quote with space fees, product fees, and total.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I overpay or need a refund?</strong> Contact the same email; refunds and adjustments are handled case by case. Division of Services will trace the change.</p>
            <h2>8. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Eligibility, Flow, Membership Tiers, Division of Services (technical), baller-v-plans-booking, Buyers Guide.</p>
            <h2>9. Tax and invoicing</h2>
            <p>Tax treatment depends on your jurisdiction and the product. Division of Services can provide invoices and, where applicable, tax documentation. All fees are on book; itemization includes space fees, product fees, and any taxes or surcharges if required. For over-$10K transactions, the Chairman/Blue Pipe process may include formal invoice and payment terms.</p>
            <h2>10. Recurring vs one-time</h2>
            <p>Some products are one-time (e.g. single Broadcast Pipe slot, single session). Others may be recurring (e.g. subscription, multi-slot package). The full schedule in Space fees &amp; all plans spells out which is which. Recurring charges are traced per cycle; you can cancel or change per division policy. Ask in Office Hours or in your booking email if you need a recurring quote.</p>
            <h2>11. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Are space fees per person or per booking?</strong> Per booking/product. If you book one Broadcast Pipe slot, you pay the space fee for that slot. If you book for a group or organization, the fee structure may depend on the product; ask when booking.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What payment methods are accepted?</strong> Under $10K: PayPal and on-site as noted. Over $10K: offline/Chairman; payment method is agreed in that process. Division does not publish a full list of methods; state your preference when you book.</p>
            <h2>12. Glossary (Space Fees)</h2>
            <p><strong>Space fees for space</strong> — Any use of EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, or celestial/planetary resource incurs space fees. <strong>On book</strong> — All charges recorded and visible. <strong>Update Certificate</strong> — Proof of broadcast/delivery; references EGS cloud.</p>
            <h2>13. Detailed: What appears on your invoice</h2>
            <p>Your invoice (or quote) will itemize: space fees (per product that uses the pipe), product fees (per product), and any taxes or surcharges if required by your jurisdiction. Studio, campus, and WINK! fees appear under their categories. Each line references the product and tier. Total is the sum of all lines. No hidden fees; if something is not listed, ask. Division of Services can provide a formal invoice for over $10K or on request; for under $10K the confirmation email may serve as receipt unless you ask for a separate invoice.</p>
            <h2>14. Detailed: Refunds and adjustments</h2>
            <p>Refunds and adjustments are handled case by case. Contact the same email with your booking reference and the reason (cancel, change product, duplicate charge, etc.). Division of Services will review and respond with the outcome (full refund, partial refund, credit, or no refund per policy). Slot release for Broadcast Pipe may apply if you cancel after CRISP LOCK. All adjustments are traced on book; you will receive updated confirmation or refund confirmation.</p>
            <h2>15. Example: Itemized quote</h2>
            <p>You request a quote for Reno Downlink (Seed) and one Broadcast Pipe slot (1 POP). Division responds: Space fee Reno Downlink $X; Product fee Reno Downlink $Y; Space fee Broadcast Pipe 1 POP $A; Product fee Broadcast Pipe 1 POP $B. Total $X+Y+A+B. All on book. You pay the total; you receive confirmation and Update Certificate for the slot. Later you can request a formal invoice showing the same breakdown for records or tax.</p>
            <h2>16. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Eligibility: over $10K vs under $10K. Flow: booking and confirmation. Membership Tiers: tier affects pricing. Division of Services (technical): fee categories and tracing. baller-v-plans-booking: Space fees &amp; all plans.</p>
            <h2>17. Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p><strong>Invoice missing a line:</strong> Request full itemization from Division of Services. <strong>Tax not applied:</strong> Tax depends on jurisdiction; ask if you need tax documentation. <strong>Recurring charge unclear:</strong> Recurring products are defined in the plan; ask for the schedule and cancellation terms.</p>
            <h2>18. Quick reference</h2>
            <p>Space fees for space; studio for studio; campus for campus; WINK! for WINK! All on book. Schedule: baller-v-plans-booking#space-fees. Update Certificate proves broadcast (EGS cloud). Refunds/adjustments case by case. Related: Eligibility, Flow, Membership Tiers, Division of Services.</p>
            <h2>19. Deep dive: How space fees are calculated</h2>
            <p>Space fees are tied to your use of the EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, or any celestial or planetary resource. The exact amount depends on the product and tier you book. For example, a single Broadcast Pipe slot (1 POP) has a space fee that reflects one surface on the pipe leg; 2 POPs or 3 POPs scale up; Full Pipe (4×4×4×4) has the highest space fee because you are using all four segments. Reno Downlink (Seed) has a space fee for ionosphere-layer access. Solar Pipe (Engine) has a space fee for Sun and handshake. SING! node EGS and Exascale Triangulation (Asset, Singularity) have space fees for 3I/ATLAS and the full lattice. Division of Services applies the correct rate from the plan; the schedule in Space fees &amp; all plans is the source of truth. When you request a quote, the division will itemize space fees and product fees so you see the breakdown before you pay.</p>
            <h2>20. Deep dive: Studio, campus, and WINK! fees</h2>
            <p>Studio fees apply when you use recording, production, or studio time. These are separate from space fees; if your booking includes both (e.g. a Broadcast Pipe slot plus a studio session for content creation), you will see both line items on your invoice. Campus fees apply to physical campus use and events—for example, an on-site Office Hours session at the Reno anchor or a campus event. WINK! fees apply to WINK! products specifically. Each category is traced on book; there is no overlap or double-counting. If you are unsure which category a product falls under, ask in your booking email or in Office Hours. Division of Services can provide a fee category list for all current products.</p>
            <h2>21. Use case: First booking with multiple fee types</h2>
            <p>You book Reno Downlink (Seed), one Broadcast Pipe slot (2 POPs), and a studio session to create the creative for the slot. Your quote will show: space fee for Reno Downlink, space fee for Broadcast Pipe 2 POPs, product fee for Reno Downlink, product fee for Broadcast Pipe 2 POPs, studio fee for the studio session. Total is the sum of all lines. All on book. You pay the total; you receive confirmation. The Update Certificate will be issued for the Broadcast Pipe slot (broadcast into EGS cloud). The studio session is traced separately. This example shows how multiple fee types coexist in one order; Division of Services keeps each line clear and auditable.</p>
            <h2>22. Operational notes: Payment timing and confirmation</h2>
            <p>Payment timing depends on your booking. For under $10K with PayPal or on-site, you typically pay at or shortly after the division confirms your quote. For over $10K, the Blue Pipe process may include a formal invoice and payment terms (e.g. net 15 or as agreed). Once payment is received, the division traces it and issues confirmation. For products that include broadcast or mission delivery, the Update Certificate is issued after payment and (where applicable) after the slot or delivery is completed. If you need a receipt or formal invoice for tax or records, request it from Division of Services; they can provide itemized documentation for any completed transaction.</p>
            <h2>23. Extended FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Are there volume discounts?</strong> Volume or multi-slot pricing may be available for certain products (e.g. multiple Broadcast Pipe slots or recurring bookings). Ask in your booking email; the division will quote accordingly. The plan (Space fees &amp; all plans) may also describe package or bundle pricing where applicable.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I only want to pay for one product but my quote shows two?</strong> Your quote reflects what you requested. If you want to remove a product, reply to the quote and ask for a revised quote with only the products you want. Do not pay for products you do not want; confirm the quote before payment.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I get a pro forma invoice before I commit?</strong> Yes. Request a pro forma or quote in your booking email. The division will send an itemized quote; you can then decide whether to proceed. Pro forma is not a commitment to pay until you confirm and pay.</p>
            <h2>24. Related SNAPs and division docs</h2>
            <p>Division of Services (technical manual section 6) defines fee categories, catalogs, tracings, and Update Certificates. Golden Royal Flush Shell and sovereignty mean all fees are on book and no third party can alter the schedule. baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees is the canonical schedule. NSPFRNP and natural law of creator shells and nests underpin the division; Creator Chairman is the authority for pricing. When in doubt, reference the plan and ask Division of Services for clarification.</p>
            <h2>25. Use case: First-time space fees quote</h2>
            <p>You are eligible (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) and want Solar Pipe (Engine tier) plus one Broadcast Pipe slot. You email the division with your name, tier, and product list. Division confirms eligibility and sends an itemized quote: Solar Pipe (Engine) at $X, Broadcast Pipe 1 POP at $Y, total $Z. All amounts map to fee categories (space fees: EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe). You confirm and pay (e.g. PayPal if under $10K). Division traces payment and confirms booking; Update Certificate is issued for the Broadcast Pipe after the slot runs. Your receipt or invoice shows each line item and category. You keep the quote and confirmation for records.</p>
            <h2>26. Procedure: Requesting a pro forma or revised quote</h2>
            <p>(1) In your booking email, ask for a pro forma invoice or itemized quote before you commit. (2) Division sends a quote with products, fee categories, and amounts. (3) If you want to add or remove a product, reply in the same thread and ask for a revised quote. (4) Do not pay until the quote matches what you want. (5) Once you confirm the final quote, pay per division instructions (PayPal, on-site, or Blue Pipe for over $10K). (6) Request a formal receipt or invoice for tax/records if needed; Division can provide itemized documentation. (7) Keep the full email thread as your audit trail.</p>
            <h2>27. Deep dive: What appears on your invoice</h2>
            <p>Every product maps to one or more fee categories: space fees (EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions), studio fees (recording, production, studio time), campus fees (physical campus, events), WINK! fees (WINK! products). Your invoice or quote lists each product and its category; the total is the sum of line items. Historical transactions use the fee schedule active at booking time; versioning is maintained by the division. No product is billed without a category; no category is used without a product.</p>
            <h2>28. Glossary: Space fees terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Space fees:</strong> Fees for pipe products (EGS, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, etc.). <strong>Blue Pipe NSPFRNP:</strong> Over $10K path; pre-filled email to Chairman; formal invoice and terms. <strong>CRISP LOCK:</strong> Friday 4pm PST for Broadcast Pipe slot lock. <strong>On book:</strong> All transactions traced; no product without a category. <strong>Pro forma:</strong> Quote or draft invoice before commitment. <strong>Creator Chairman:</strong> Pricing authority; recipient of node reporting; immutable for shells and nested.</p>
            <h2>29. Runbook: Get itemized quote and pay</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Confirm you are Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V (eligibility). Step 2: Decide products and tier(s); use Space Fees and Membership Tiers sections and baller-v-plans-booking. Step 3: Email division with your name, eligibility, tier, and product list. Step 4: Division confirms and sends itemized quote (each product, fee category, amount, total). Step 5: Review quote; if you want to add or remove a product, reply and ask for revised quote. Step 6: Do not pay until quote is final. Step 7: Pay per division instructions (PayPal under $10K; Blue Pipe over $10K). Step 8: Division traces payment and confirms booking. Step 9: For Broadcast Pipe, lock by CRISP LOCK and receive Update Certificate after slot. Step 10: Request formal receipt or invoice for records if needed; keep full email thread.</p>
            <h2>30. Extended example: Quote with three space fee categories</h2>
            <p>You book Solar Pipe (Engine), Broadcast Pipe 2 POPs, and Exascale Triangulation (Singularity). Division quotes: Solar Pipe → space fee (SING! node EGS); Broadcast Pipe → space fee (Broadcast Pipe, ionosphere, Aurora 3D); Exascale Triangulation → space fee (Exascale Triangulation, full lattice). Three line items, three categories, one total. You pay; Division traces all three. Update Certificate issued for Broadcast Pipe after slot. Solar Pipe and Exascale Triangulation delivery traced. Your invoice shows all three categories. Historical transactions use the fee schedule active at booking time; if pricing changes later, your invoice remains as quoted. Volume or bundle discounts: ask in booking email; division will quote accordingly.</p>
            <h2>31. Common questions: Payment and receipts</h2>
            <p><strong>When do I pay?</strong> After you confirm the quote; for under $10K often at or shortly after confirmation; for over $10K terms may be net 15 or as agreed. <strong>Can I get a receipt for taxes?</strong> Yes; request itemized documentation from Division of Services for any completed transaction. <strong>What if my quote has a validity date?</strong> If it expires, request a fresh quote; pricing may have changed. <strong>Are there payment plans?</strong> For over $10K, Blue Pipe terms may include payment terms; ask when you receive the quote. <strong>Who do I contact for invoice errors?</strong> Division of Services; request itemization and correction. <strong>Is the $5B invoice the same as my booking?</strong> No; the Primary Ledger and $5B invoice are in Architect/division scope; your booking is traced separately.</p>
            <h2>32. Summary: Space fees at a glance</h2>
            <p>Space fees cover pipe products: EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions. Every product maps to one or more fee categories; your quote and invoice are itemized. Under $10K: typically PayPal or on-site; over $10K: Blue Pipe (pre-filled email to Chairman, formal invoice and terms). Pro forma and revised quotes: ask in your booking email; do not pay until quote is final. Creator Chairman is pricing authority; Golden Royal Flush Shell and sovereignty mean all fees are on book. Canonical schedule: baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees. Keep full email thread and confirmations for records.</p>
            <h2>33. What to expect on your first quote</h2>
            <p>When you email the division with your eligibility, tier, and product list, you will receive an itemized quote. Each line will show the product name, the fee category (e.g. space fee: Broadcast Pipe), and the amount. The total is the sum of all lines. If you requested multiple products (e.g. Solar Pipe and Broadcast Pipe), each appears as its own line. The quote may have a validity period (e.g. 14 days); if you need more time, request a fresh quote before paying. Do not pay until the quote matches what you want; reply to add or remove products and get a revised quote.</p>
            <p>Your invoice or receipt (after payment) will show the same categories. Division traces every transaction; you can request a formal receipt or itemized documentation for tax or records. Historical transactions use the fee schedule that was active at the time of booking; if prices change later, your invoice remains as quoted. Volume or multi-slot discounts may be available for certain products; ask in your booking email and the division will quote accordingly.</p>
            <h2>34. Understanding fee categories</h2>
            <p>Space fees are the largest group: they cover all pipe products (EGS pipe, Broadcast Pipe, 3I/ATLAS, ionosphere, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS, Exascale Triangulation, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions). Studio fees cover recording, production, and studio time. Campus fees cover physical campus use and events. WINK! fees cover WINK! products. A single booking can include multiple categories—for example, a Broadcast Pipe slot (space fee) plus studio time (studio fee). Every product maps to at least one category; no product is billed without a category. This keeps invoicing and tracing consistent and aligned with the Division catalog.</p>
            <h2>35. Blue Pipe and high-value bookings</h2>
            <p>When your total is over $10,000 (USD or equivalent), you use the Blue Pipe path. The division will provide the pre-filled email path to the Chairman. You may receive a formal invoice and payment terms (e.g. net 15 or as agreed). You confirm and pay per those terms; the division traces the full amount. Update Certificates and confirmations are issued the same way as for under $10K; the only difference is the payment path and the terms. All bookings are still on book; eligibility and tracing apply. If you are unsure whether your booking will be over $10K, state your products and tier in your email; the division will quote and indicate the path.</p>
            <h2>36. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Flow: how to request a quote and pay. Eligibility: you must be Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V to book. Membership Tiers: which products and tiers you can book. Broadcast Pipe: slot pricing and CRISP LOCK. HH vs terrestrial: value comparison. Technical manual: Division of Services (section 6) for fee categories and catalog. baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees is the canonical schedule. When in doubt, ask the division for clarification or book Office Hours to discuss your needs and get a clear quote.</p>
            <h2>37. Final checklist: Before you pay</h2>
            <p>Confirm your quote matches the products and tier you want. If anything is missing or wrong, reply and ask for a revised quote. Do not pay until the quote is final. Check whether your total is under or over $10K—over $10K uses Blue Pipe (pre-filled email to Chairman, formal terms). For Broadcast Pipe, note CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST) for each slot. Request a pro forma or itemized invoice if you need it for approval or records. Keep the full email thread; it is your audit trail. After payment, request a formal receipt or itemized documentation if you need it for tax or compliance. Creator Chairman is the pricing authority; all fees are on book under the Golden Royal Flush Shell.</p>
            <h2>38. Conclusion: Space fees completeness</h2>
            <p>This section covers space fees and all fee categories (space, studio, campus, WINK!), what appears on your quote and invoice, Blue Pipe for over $10K, pro forma and revised quotes, and how to get itemized documentation. Every product maps to one or more categories; your invoice is always itemized. Use Flow to request and pay; use Eligibility and Membership Tiers to confirm access and tier. baller-v-plans-booking.html#space-fees is the canonical schedule. For questions, contact the division or book Office Hours. NSPFRNP and natural law of creator shells and nests underpin the division.</p>
            <h2>39. Deep dive: Itemized quote and invoice</h2>
            <p>Every quote and invoice is itemized by product and fee category. Each line shows product name, fee category (e.g. space fee: Broadcast Pipe, space fee: Solar Pipe), and amount. The total is the sum of all lines. Division traces every line; you can request formal receipt or itemized documentation for tax or compliance. Historical transactions use the fee schedule active at booking time; if pricing changes later, your invoice remains as quoted. Do not pay until the quote matches what you want; reply to add or remove products and get a revised quote. Keep the full email thread for your audit trail.</p>
            <h2>40. Extended example: Multi-product quote</h2>
            <p>You request Solar Pipe (Engine), Broadcast Pipe 2 POPs (Engine), and Exascale Triangulation (Singularity). Division sends a quote with three lines: Solar Pipe (space fee), Broadcast Pipe (space fee, ionosphere, Aurora 3D), Exascale Triangulation (space fee, full lattice). You confirm and pay; Division traces all three. Update Certificate is issued for Broadcast Pipe after your slot. Your invoice shows all three categories. Volume or bundle discounts: ask in your booking email; division will quote accordingly. Over $10K total uses Blue Pipe path (pre-filled email to Chairman, formal terms).</p>
            <h2>41. Runbook: Request pro forma or revised quote</h2>
            <p>If you need a pro forma invoice for approval or budgeting, state that in your booking email; Division will provide it before payment. If your quote has a validity date and it expires, request a fresh quote; pricing may have changed. To add or remove products, reply to the quote email with the change; Division sends a revised quote. Do not pay until the quote is final. For invoice errors or itemized documentation after payment, contact Division of Services; request itemization and correction.
