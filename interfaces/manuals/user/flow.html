        <article>
            <h2>1. Principle</h2>
            <p>Always <strong>experience first, then book</strong>. Visit the <a href="../../space-cloud-egs-series.html">Space Cloud EGS series</a> to experience the stories and the stack. Then <a href="mailto:info@fractiai.com?subject=Holographic%20Hydrogen%20Space%20Cloud%20Division%20%E2%80%94%20Book">book via email</a> with your chosen tier and scale.</p>
            <h2>2. What this applies to</h2>
            <p>Flow applies to every product: Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS Deep Space, Exascale Triangulation, Broadcast Pipe Ad Space, Sun Spots, Schumann sessions. Experience the content and the mission first; then book with tier/scale and any special requests.</p>
            <h2>3. Why experience first</h2>
            <p>The division is built on the principle that you should understand what you are buying. The Space Cloud EGS series, Live Pulse, AR4366, 3I/ATLAS, Schumann Campaign, and the rest of the stack are not abstract: they are stories, interfaces, and a real pipe. Experiencing them first ensures that your booking is informed and that you choose the right tier and scale. It also aligns with NSPFRNP and MCA: you metabolize the content, crystallize your choice, then animate (book). No pressure to book before you are ready; Office Hours are available for questions.</p>
            <h2>4. Step-by-step: experience</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Visit the <a href="../../space-cloud-egs-series.html">Space Cloud EGS series</a> and consume the stories and the stack. Step 2: Explore <a href="../../sing-pulse.html">Live Pulse</a>, <a href="../../ar4366.html">AR 4366</a>, <a href="../../goldilocks-3i-atlas.html">3I/ATLAS &amp; Goldilocks</a>, <a href="../../schumann-campaign.html">Schumann Campaign</a>, <a href="../../exascale-triangulation.html">Exascale Triangulation</a>, and <a href="../../broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html">Broadcast Pipe Ad Space</a> as needed for your interests. Step 3: Read the <a href="../../buyers-guide.html">Buyers Guide</a> (HH vs terrestrial, Us vs. top 3 singularity) and <a href="../../space-cloud-division.html">Space Cloud Division</a> for tier and product comparison. Step 4: When ready, proceed to book.</p>
            <h2>5. Step-by-step: book</h2>
            <p>Book via email: <a href="mailto:info@fractiai.com?subject=Holographic%20Hydrogen%20Space%20Cloud%20Division%20%E2%80%94%20Book">info@fractiai.com</a> with subject “Holographic Hydrogen Space Cloud Division — Book.” Include: your chosen tier (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity), product(s), scale, and any special requests. For transactions over $10K you will receive a pre-filled email to the Chairman; for under $10K, PayPal or on-site options will be offered. After payment, you receive confirmation and, where applicable, an Update Certificate. All space fees and product fees are on book.</p>
            <h2>6. Special requests</h2>
            <p>Special requests (custom placement, timing, multi-product bundles, etc.) are handled in the same flow. State them in your booking email. The division will confirm feasibility and pricing. Custom requests may require offline/Chairman handling even below $10K if they involve non-standard terms. CRISP LOCK applies to Broadcast Pipe: lock by Friday 4pm PST at base; after cutoff, gate premium.</p>
            <h2>7. FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I book without experiencing first?</strong> You can, but the division strongly recommends experience first. It reduces mismatch between expectation and product and supports informed tier choice.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How long does booking take?</strong> For under $10K with standard product: often same day or next. For over $10K or custom: Chairman response and Blue Pipe process may take a few days. Office Hours can give a rough timeline.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I want to change tier after booking?</strong> Contact the same email; upgrades and changes are handled case by case. Division of Services will trace the change and any fee adjustment.</p>
            <h2>8. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V), Membership Tiers, Space Fees, Office Hours, Buyers Guide, Space Cloud EGS series, Broadcast Pipe Ad Space. Technical manual: Division of Services, Stack Components (Presentation layer).</p>
            <h2>9. Multi-product and bundle flow</h2>
            <p>You can book multiple products in one email (e.g. Reno Downlink + Broadcast Pipe slot, or Solar Pipe + Exascale Triangulation). State all products, tiers, and any bundle requests. Division of Services will quote and trace each line; space fees and product fees are itemized. Bundles may have discounted pricing if advertised; otherwise each product is priced per plan. Same flow: experience first, then book with full list.</p>
            <h2>10. Rebooking and changes</h2>
            <p>To change a booking (date, tier, product, or cancel): contact the same email with your original booking reference and the requested change. Upgrades (e.g. Seed → Engine) are handled case by case; any fee difference is on book. Cancellations may be subject to division policy (e.g. slot release, partial refund); ask when you request the change. CRISP LOCK for Broadcast Pipe: if you need to move a slot, do it before the Friday 4pm PST lock where possible.</p>
            <h2>11. Post-booking: confirmation and certificate</h2>
            <p>After payment you receive confirmation (email or equivalent). For products that include broadcast or mission delivery, you receive an Update Certificate. The certificate proves broadcast into the EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723) and is stored in 3I/ATLAS. Keep your confirmation and certificate for records; Division of Services also traces everything on book.</p>
            <h2>12. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I book for someone else?</strong> Yes, if you are eligible. Specify in the email (e.g. "booking on behalf of X" or "gift for Y"). The contracting party and payment are still under your eligibility unless a separate arrangement is made with the division.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I don't know my tier yet?</strong> Use Office Hours or the Buyers Guide to decide. You can also state "need tier recommendation" in your email; the division will suggest based on your goals (grounding, solar, cold proof, full lattice).</p>
            <h2>13. Glossary (Flow)</h2>
            <p><strong>Experience first</strong> — Consume Space Cloud EGS series and relevant interfaces before booking. <strong>CRISP LOCK</strong> — Lock Broadcast Pipe slots by Friday 4pm PST for base pricing. <strong>On book</strong> — All charges traced and visible.</p>
            <h2>14. Detailed: What to include in your booking email</h2>
            <p>Include: your name or organization, your eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V confirmed), the product(s) you want (e.g. Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, Broadcast Pipe slot, Exascale Triangulation), your chosen tier(s) if product-specific, scale (e.g. 1 POP vs Full Pipe), any special requests (date, hemisphere, creative). For Broadcast Pipe include your creative (text, link, or asset) and desired slot time. The division will respond with a quote (itemized), payment instructions, and any questions. Reply with payment and any follow-up; you then receive confirmation and certificate where applicable.</p>
            <h2>15. Detailed: After you book</h2>
            <p>After payment you receive confirmation (email or equivalent). For products that include broadcast or mission delivery, you receive an Update Certificate; it proves broadcast into the EGS cloud (Sun, Earth, 3I/ATLAS, Sag A*, SMACS 0723). Store your confirmation and certificate. Division of Services has traced the transaction on book; you can request an itemized invoice or receipt at any time. For recurring products, you will receive cycle-based confirmation per the plan. For Broadcast Pipe, your slot is reserved and your creative is scheduled for the pipe at the booked time.</p>
            <h2>16. Example: Multi-product booking</h2>
            <p>You want Seed (Reno Downlink) and Engine (Solar Pipe) and one Broadcast Pipe slot (2 POPs). You experience the EGS series and Live Pulse first. You email with all three products. Division confirms eligibility and quotes: space fees + product fees for Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, and 2 POPs Broadcast Pipe; total under $10K. You pay via PayPal. Division traces all three; issues Update Certificate for the Broadcast Pipe slot. You receive one confirmation covering all three; certificate for the slot. All on book; future bookings can add or change products.</p>
            <h2>17. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Eligibility: must be Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V. Membership Tiers: choose tier per product. Space Fees: understand what's on book. Broadcast Pipe: CRISP LOCK and slot details. Live Pulse & HELLO: verify pipe state after booking. Technical manual: Division of Services, Stack Components (Presentation).</p>
            <h2>18. Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p><strong>No response to booking email:</strong> Allow a few days for over $10K or complex requests; for under $10K standard product, follow up after 2–3 business days. <strong>Quote doesn't match plan:</strong> Ask for itemization; verify product and tier; check Space fees &amp; all plans. <strong>Need to change date or product:</strong> Reply to the same thread or contact email; changes are case-by-case and traced.</p>
            <h2>19. Quick reference</h2>
            <p>Flow: experience first (Space Cloud EGS series, Live Pulse, division pages), then book via email. Include: products, tier(s), scale, special requests. Over $10K: Chairman path. Under $10K: PayPal or on-site. Confirmation and Update Certificate after payment. CRISP LOCK for Broadcast Pipe: Friday 4pm PST. Related: Eligibility, Membership Tiers, Space Fees, Office Hours, Buyers Guide.</p>
            <h2>20. Deep dive: The experience-first loop</h2>
            <p>Experience first means you engage with the content and the stack before you commit money. Visit the Space Cloud EGS series to read and watch the stories; open Live Pulse to see the handshake, 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, and HELLO; explore AR 4366, 3I/ATLAS &amp; Goldilocks, Schumann Campaign, Exascale Triangulation, and Broadcast Pipe Ad Space as needed. Read the Buyers Guide (HH vs terrestrial, Us vs. top 3 singularity) and the Space Cloud Division page. This loop helps you understand what you are buying: the EGS pipe, the mirror, the cold proof, the lattice. It also aligns with NSPFRNP and MCA: you metabolize the content, crystallize your choice, then animate (book). No pressure to book on the first visit; Office Hours are available for questions. When you are ready, you send the booking email with your chosen products and tier(s).</p>
            <h2>21. Deep dive: What happens after you send the booking email</h2>
            <p>After you send your booking email, the division reviews it. They confirm your eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V), check product and tier, and prepare a quote. The quote is itemized: space fees, product fees, and any taxes or surcharges if applicable. If your total is over $10K, they may send a pre-filled email to the Chairman and instruct you to use the Blue Pipe process. If under $10K, they will send payment instructions (PayPal or on-site). You pay; the division traces the payment and confirms your booking. For products that include broadcast or mission delivery, you receive an Update Certificate. For Broadcast Pipe, you also submit your creative and lock by CRISP LOCK (Friday 4pm PST) if you have not already. The whole flow is traced on book; you can request an itemized invoice or receipt at any time.</p>
            <h2>22. Use case: Booking with special requests</h2>
            <p>You want a custom date range for Reno Downlink, a specific meridian for your Broadcast Pipe slot, and a multi-product bundle. You state all of this in your booking email. The division will respond with questions or a custom quote. Custom requests may take a few days to price and confirm. If the bundle or custom terms are approved, you receive a quote that reflects the special requests. You pay; the division traces the custom booking. Special requests do not bypass eligibility or the flow; they are part of the same on-book process. For very large or complex requests (e.g. enterprise or multi-slot campaigns), the over-$10K path and Chairman may be used even if the total is under $10K, at the division's discretion.</p>
            <h2>23. Operational notes: Response times and follow-up</h2>
            <p>Standard booking (under $10K, clear product list) often gets a response within one to three business days. Over $10K or custom requests may take longer. If you do not hear back within five business days, send a polite follow-up to the same email thread. Do not assume your email was lost; the division may be processing multiple requests. Once you have a quote, reply with your confirmation and payment; the division will then confirm the booking and issue the certificate where applicable. Keep the whole thread for your records; it is your audit trail for the flow.</p>
            <h2>24. Extended FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I book without visiting the EGS series?</strong> You can, but the division strongly recommends experience first. It reduces mismatch and supports informed choice. If you are in a hurry, at least skim the division page and Buyers Guide before you book.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if my quote expires?</strong> Quotes may have a validity period (e.g. 14 days). If your quote has expired, request a fresh quote. Pricing may have changed; the division will requote. There is no penalty for letting a quote expire.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I book on behalf of a group?</strong> Yes. Specify in your email that you are booking on behalf of a group or organization. The contracting party and payment are still under your eligibility unless a separate arrangement (e.g. invoice to company) is made with the division.</p>
            <h2>25. Related technical and division docs</h2>
            <p>Technical manual: Division of Services (billing, tracing, fee categories, Update Certificates). Stack Components (Presentation layer: interfaces, thin clients). Eligibility and Membership Tiers in this user manual. Space Fees for what appears on your quote. Office Hours and Buyers Guide for pre-booking support. NSPFRNP and MCA underpin the flow; experience first is the user-facing expression of metabolize and crystallize before animate.</p>
            <h2>26. Use case: Over $10K booking (Blue Pipe)</h2>
            <p>Your total is over $10K (e.g. multiple Broadcast Pipe slots, Singularity tier, or custom campaign). You use the pre-filled email path to Chairman (Blue Pipe NSPFRNP). You send your request; the division routes it and may respond with a formal invoice and payment terms (e.g. net 15 or as agreed). You sign or confirm; you pay per terms. The division traces the full amount and issues confirmations and Update Certificates where applicable. The whole flow is still on book: experience first (or at least division page and Buyers Guide), then request, quote, confirm, pay. High-value does not skip eligibility or tracing.</p>
            <h2>27. Procedure: Standard booking from start to confirmation</h2>
            <p>(1) Confirm eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). (2) Experience first: visit division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide. (3) Decide products and tier(s). (4) Email division with name, eligibility, tier, and product list. (5) Division confirms and sends itemized quote. (6) You confirm quote and pay (PayPal if under $10K; Blue Pipe if over). (7) Division traces payment and confirms booking. (8) For Broadcast Pipe: lock by CRISP LOCK, submit creative; after slot, receive Update Certificate. (9) Keep full email thread and confirmations for records. (10) For questions, use same thread or Office Hours.</p>
            <h2>28. Deep dive: Why experience first</h2>
            <p>Experience first means engaging with the division page, EGS series, and/or Buyers Guide before you book. It reduces mismatch: you see what the pipe and products are, and you can make an informed choice. It aligns with NSPFRNP and MCA: metabolize (take in the experience), crystallize (decide what you want), animate (book and pay). The division strongly recommends it but does not block booking if you are in a hurry; at least skim the materials. Office Hours can substitute for or supplement experience: a session where you describe your goal and get a recommendation counts as crystallizing before you animate.</p>
            <h2>29. Glossary: Flow terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Experience first:</strong> Engage with division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide before booking. <strong>On book:</strong> All steps traced; no off-book transactions. <strong>Blue Pipe NSPFRNP:</strong> Over $10K path; pre-filled email to Chairman. <strong>CRISP LOCK:</strong> Friday 4pm PST for Broadcast Pipe slot lock. <strong>Quote validity:</strong> Quotes may have a validity period (e.g. 14 days); request a fresh quote if expired. <strong>Audit trail:</strong> Your email thread and confirmations; keep for records.</p>
            <h2>30. Runbook: Standard booking (start to finish)</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Confirm eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Step 2: Experience first: division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide (or at least skim). Step 3: Decide products and tier(s). Step 4: Email division with name, eligibility, tier, and product list. Step 5: Division confirms and sends itemized quote. Step 6: You confirm quote and pay (PayPal under $10K; Blue Pipe over $10K). Step 7: Division traces payment and confirms booking. Step 8: For Broadcast Pipe: lock by CRISP LOCK, submit creative; after slot, receive Update Certificate. Step 9: Keep full email thread and confirmations for records. Step 10: For follow-up or changes, use same thread or Office Hours. Response time: under $10K often one to three business days; over $10K or custom may take longer; follow up after five business days if no response.</p>
            <h2>31. Extended example: Custom request (multi-product, custom date)</h2>
            <p>You want Reno Downlink for a specific date range, a meridian preference for Broadcast Pipe, and a multi-product bundle. You state all of this in your booking email. Division may respond with questions or a custom quote. Custom requests can take a few days to price and confirm. If the bundle or custom terms are approved, you receive a quote that reflects the special requests. You pay; division traces the custom booking. Special requests do not bypass eligibility or the flow; they are part of the same on-book process. For very large or complex requests (e.g. enterprise or multi-slot campaigns), the over-$10K path and Chairman may be used even if the total is under $10K, at the division's discretion.</p>
            <h2>32. Common questions: Response and follow-up</h2>
            <p><strong>How long until I get a quote?</strong> Standard (under $10K, clear product list) often one to three business days; over $10K or custom may take longer. <strong>What if I don't hear back?</strong> Send a polite follow-up after five business days on the same thread. <strong>Can I book for someone else?</strong> You can book on behalf of a group or as a gift; contracting party and payment are under your eligibility unless a separate arrangement (e.g. invoice to company) is made with the division. <strong>What if my quote expires?</strong> Request a fresh quote; pricing may have changed. <strong>Do I have to visit before I book?</strong> Division strongly recommends experience first; if in a hurry, at least skim the division page and Buyers Guide. <strong>Where do I send the booking email?</strong> Use the contact path on the division page or baller-v-plans-booking; over $10K use the pre-filled Chairman path (Blue Pipe).</p>
            <h2>33. Summary: Flow at a glance</h2>
            <p>Eligibility first (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Experience first: division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide. Then email with products and tier → division quotes → you confirm and pay (PayPal under $10K; Blue Pipe over $10K) → division traces and confirms. For Broadcast Pipe: CRISP LOCK, creative, slot runs, Update Certificate. Keep full email thread for audit trail. All on book; no off-book transactions. Response: under $10K often one to three business days; follow up after five if no response. Custom requests: state in email; division may requote. NSPFRNP and MCA underpin the flow; experience first = metabolize and crystallize before animate.</p>
            <h2>34. Step-by-step: From interest to confirmation</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Confirm you are Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V (see Eligibility section). Step 2: Experience first—visit the division page, EGS series, and/or Buyers Guide so you know what you want. Step 3: Decide your products and tier(s) (see Membership Tiers and Space Fees). Step 4: Email the division with your name, eligibility, tier, and product list. Step 5: Division confirms and sends an itemized quote. Step 6: Review the quote; if you want to add or remove products, reply and ask for a revised quote. Step 7: Once the quote is final, confirm and pay (PayPal for under $10K; Blue Pipe for over $10K). Step 8: Division traces payment and sends confirmation. Step 9: For Broadcast Pipe, meet CRISP LOCK and receive your Update Certificate after the slot. Step 10: Keep the full email thread and all confirmations for your records.</p>
            <h2>35. What "experience first" means in practice</h2>
            <p>Experience first means engaging with the division materials before you book. That could mean reading the division page (space-cloud-division.html), watching or reading the EGS series, and/or using the Buyers Guide to compare HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity. The goal is to reduce mismatch: you see what the pipe and products are, and you can make an informed choice. The division strongly recommends it but does not block booking if you are in a hurry—at least skim the materials. Office Hours can substitute: a session where you describe your goal and get a recommendation counts as crystallizing before you animate. NSPFRNP and MCA (Metabolize, Crystallize, Animate) underpin the flow; experience first is the user-facing expression of that cycle.</p>
            <h2>36. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Eligibility: confirm Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V before you book. Membership Tiers: choose products and tier. Space Fees: what appears on your quote. Broadcast Pipe: slot flow and CRISP LOCK. Technical manual: Division of Services (billing, tracing). Office Hours and Buyers Guide for pre-booking support. When in doubt, use the same email thread for follow-up or book Office Hours to clarify.</p>
            <h2>37. Final checklist: Standard booking (start to finish)</h2>
            <p>Confirm eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Experience first: division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide (or skim). Decide products and tier(s). Email division with name, eligibility, tier, and product list. Wait for quote (under $10K often one to three business days; over $10K or custom may take longer; follow up after five business days if no response). Review quote; reply to add or remove products if needed. Confirm and pay (PayPal under $10K; Blue Pipe over $10K). Division traces and confirms. For Broadcast Pipe: meet CRISP LOCK, submit creative; after slot, receive Update Certificate. Keep full email thread and confirmations. All on book; no off-book transactions. NSPFRNP and MCA underpin the flow.</p>
            <h2>38. Conclusion: Flow completeness</h2>
            <p>This section covers the full booking flow: eligibility first, experience first, request, quote, confirm, pay, and (for Broadcast Pipe) CRISP LOCK and certificate. Response times, follow-up, custom requests, and group booking are included. Use Eligibility, Membership Tiers, Space Fees, and Broadcast Pipe sections together. Technical manual: Division of Services. Office Hours and Buyers Guide for support. Keep your audit trail (email thread and confirmations). Natural coordination and MCA (Metabolize, Crystallize, Animate) underpin the flow.</p>
            <h2>39. Deep dive: Experience first and MCA</h2>
            <p>Experience first means engaging with division materials before you book: division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide. It aligns with NSPFRNP and MCA: Metabolize (digest what the pipe and products are), Crystallize (decide what you want), Animate (book and pay). The division strongly recommends it but does not block booking if you are in a hurry—at least skim. Office Hours can substitute: a session where you describe your goal and get a recommendation counts as crystallizing before you animate. All transactions are on book; no off-book steps. Keep the full email thread for your audit trail.</p>
            <h2>40. Extended example: Group booking and gift</h2>
            <p>You want to book on behalf of a group or as a gift. Contracting party and payment are under your membership (your eligibility); the recipient does not need eligibility. State in your email that you are booking for others; Division will quote and trace under your name. For entity-level invoicing or custom arrangements (e.g. company pays, multiple bookers), contact the division or Office Hours; the rule that eligibility is personal still underpins the flow. Division traces every booking to an eligible contracting party. Keep the full email thread for records.</p>
            <h2>41. Runbook: No response or delayed quote</h2>
            <p>Standard (under $10K, clear product list): often one to three business days. Over $10K or custom: may take longer. If you do not hear back: send a polite follow-up after five business days on the same thread. Do not assume the request was lost; Division may be queueing or awaiting internal approval. If your quote expires, request a fresh quote; pricing may have changed. Where to send: use the contact path on the division page or baller-v-plans-booking; over $10K use the pre-filled Chairman path (Blue Pipe). For very large or complex requests, the over-$10K path may be used at Division discretion even if total is under $10K.</p>
            <h2>42. Summary at a glance: Flow</h2>
            <p>Eligibility first (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Experience first: division page, EGS series, Buyers Guide. Email with products and tier → quote → confirm and pay (PayPal under $10K; Blue Pipe over $10K) → Division traces and confirms. Broadcast Pipe: CRISP LOCK, creative, slot runs, Update Certificate. Keep full email thread. Response: under $10K often one to three days; follow up after five if no response. NSPFRNP and MCA underpin the flow.</p>
            <h2>43. Deep dive: On book and audit trail</h2>
            <p>Every transaction is on book: request, quote, payment, slot, creative, Update Certificate. Division captures customer, products, tier, amounts, method, timestamp. No step without trace. Keep the full email thread and all confirmations; it is your audit trail. For follow-up or changes, use the same thread or Office Hours. Refunds and adjustments are case-by-case and traced. Custom requests (multi-product, custom date) do not bypass eligibility or the flow; they are part of the same on-book process. All node reporting and natural law of creator shells and nests underpin the division.</p>
            <h2>44. Procedure: Standard booking (step-by-step)</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Confirm you are Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V (see Eligibility section). Step 2: Experience first—visit the division page, EGS series, and/or Buyers Guide. Step 3: Decide your products and tier(s) (see Membership Tiers and Space Fees). Step 4: Email the division with your name, eligibility, tier, and product list. Step 5: Division confirms and sends an itemized quote. Step 6: Review the quote; if you want to add or remove products, reply and ask for a revised quote. Step 7: Once the quote is final, confirm and pay (PayPal for under $10K; Blue Pipe for over $10K). Step 8: Division traces payment and sends confirmation. Step 9: For Broadcast Pipe, meet CRISP LOCK and receive your Update Certificate after the slot. Step 10: Keep the full email thread and all confirmations for your records.</p>
            <h2>45. Common questions: Response and follow-up</h2>
            <p><strong>How long until I get a quote?</strong> Standard (under $10K, clear product list) often one to three business days; over $10K or custom may take longer. <strong>What if I don't hear back?</strong> Send a polite follow-up after five business days on the same thread. <strong>Can I book for someone else?</strong> You can book on behalf of a group or as a gift; contracting party and payment are under your eligibility unless a separate arrangement is made with the division. <strong>What if my quote expires?</strong> Request a fresh quote; pricing may have changed. <strong>Do I have to visit before I book?</strong> Division strongly recommends experience first; if in a hurry, at least skim the division page and Buyers Guide. <strong>Where do I send the booking email?</strong> Use the contact path on the division page or baller-v-plans-booking; over $10K use the pre-filled Chairman path (Blue Pipe).</p>
