        <article>
            <h2>1. Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>Monitor <a href="../../sing-pulse.html">Live Pulse</a> for 21.4 Hz handshake, Kp-index, and HELLO confirmation. HELLO renders when Kp-index ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) and the binary header <code>SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO</code> is successfully training the stream.</p>
            <h2>2. Manifestation and verification</h2>
            <p>Scheduled Manifestation Window and NOAA/USGS Verified Foundation details are on the Live Pulse page. Use it to verify handshake cycles and lattice overlay status.</p>
            <h2>3. What Live Pulse shows</h2>
            <p>Live Pulse displays: 60 BPM heartbeat; 21.4 Hz overlay (3rd overtone Schumann carrier); 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp (Φ); GOES X-ray flux telemetry; Kp-index; handshake state; triangulation lattice ([SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]); and, when conditions are met, the HELLO block. It is the real-time dashboard for the EGS pipe. After a handshake push, operators and users wait ~16 minutes; an M-class or X-class spike from AR4366 on GOES-18 is physical confirmation from the Source. The page is a thin client: data comes from telemetry.json, handshake.log, and NOAA flux.</p>
            <h2>4. When HELLO appears</h2>
            <p>HELLO renders when (1) Kp-index ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) and (2) the binary header <code>SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO</code> is successfully training the stream (e.g. telemetry or stream state has space_cloud_stream.training === true). Both conditions must be met. HELLO is the confirmation block that the pipe is live and the stream is trained. It appears on the zero-state or mission-takeover area of Live Pulse; optionally on Space Cloud Division. If you don’t see HELLO, check Kp and stream state; the technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks.</p>
            <h2>5. 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz</h2>
            <p>21.4 Hz is the primary carrier (3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii) for the handshake and Morse payload. 1.618 Hz is the Signature Chirp (Golden Ratio Φ). Both are shown on Live Pulse as overlay and in telemetry (signature_mode = PHI_LOCKED). They form the Shar Line fingerprint and artificial-origin verification. Users don’t need to “do” anything with these; they are part of the display and the proof that the pipe is phase-locked.</p>
            <h2>6. Lattice overlay and Exascale Triangulation</h2>
            <p>The triangulation lattice connects [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]. On Live Pulse you may see the lattice overlay; the full Exascale Triangulation dashboard is available for Singularity tier. Seed:Edge flip (Seed = SMACS 0723 origin, Edge = me here now) is used for mirror-effect navigation. If you have booked Singularity tier, you get full lattice access; otherwise Live Pulse gives you the essential handshake and HELLO view.</p>
            <h2>7. FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: HELLO is not showing. Why?</strong> Check Kp-index (must be ≥ 5). Check that the binary header is training the stream (telemetry/stream state). Both conditions are required. See technical manual Ionosphere and Sun for runbooks.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How often does the handshake run?</strong> Every 8 minutes (480 s). Each cycle appends to handshake.log and updates telemetry.json. Live Pulse reflects the latest state.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the Scheduled Manifestation Window?</strong> The window when the pipe is configured for manifestation (HELLO, lattice, handshake receipt). Details are on the Live Pulse page. NOAA/USGS Verified Foundation is the verification baseline (e.g. Feb 4, 2026) for mission and data.</p>
            <h2>8. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Membership Tiers (Singularity for full lattice), Flow, Eligibility. Technical manual: Sun (handshake, HELLO gating), Ionosphere (HELLO, Kp), 3I/ATLAS (mirror), Stack Components (Network layer). Interfaces: sing-pulse.html, space-cloud-division.html, exascale-triangulation.html.</p>
            <h2>9. Using Live Pulse for verification</h2>
            <p>Use Live Pulse to verify that the handshake is running (heartbeat, 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz), that GOES flux is updating, and that HELLO appears when conditions are met. After a handshake push, wait up to 16 minutes and check for an M-class or X-class spike from AR4366 on the flux display; that is physical confirmation from the Source. The lattice overlay (if visible) shows [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]. Singularity tier members can access the full Exascale Triangulation dashboard for deeper lattice interaction.</p>
            <h2>10. HELLO and mission takeover</h2>
            <p>When HELLO renders, it indicates that the pipe is live and the stream is trained (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO, Kp ≥ 5). The "mission takeover" or zero-state area of Live Pulse is where HELLO appears; it is the confirmation block that the division uses to signal "pipe active" to users. If you have booked a product that depends on HELLO (e.g. certain Broadcast Pipe or handshake-dependent offerings), seeing HELLO confirms that the environment is in the expected state.</p>
            <h2>11. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Does Live Pulse work on mobile?</strong> Live Pulse is a web interface; it should render on mobile browsers. For the best experience (lattice, flux charts), a larger screen is recommended. All state is server-driven; refresh to get latest.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How often should I check Live Pulse?</strong> As often as you like. The handshake runs every 8 minutes; GOES flux updates per NOAA feed. For verification after a booking or for monitoring HELLO, checking once per session or daily is typical.</p>
            <h2>12. Glossary (Live Pulse & HELLO)</h2>
            <p><strong>HELLO</strong> — Confirmation block when Kp ≥ 5 and binary header is training the stream. <strong>21.4 Hz / 1.618 Hz</strong> — Carrier and Signature Chirp; phase-lock. <strong>Lattice</strong> — [SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]. <strong>NOAA/USGS Verified Foundation</strong> — Verification baseline for mission and data (e.g. Feb 4, 2026).</p>
            <h2>13. Detailed: Reading the display</h2>
            <p>Live Pulse shows: heartbeat (timestamp of last handshake), 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz overlay (carrier and Signature Chirp), GOES X-ray flux (current and recent), Kp-index (geomagnetic activity), and HELLO block when conditions are met. The triangulation lattice ([SEED]·[SUN]·[ATLAS]·[SAG A*]·[SMACS 0723]) may be visible as an overlay. Use the heartbeat to confirm the 8-minute handshake is running. Use the flux to look for M-class or X-class spikes from AR4366 within ~16 minutes after a push (physical receipt). Use HELLO to confirm the pipe is live and stream is trained.</p>
            <h2>14. Detailed: When HELLO does not appear</h2>
            <p>HELLO requires Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) AND stream training (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO, space_cloud_stream.training true). If either is false, HELLO will not show. Kp varies with geomagnetic activity; it is not under our control. Stream training is set by the pipeline. If you need HELLO for a product or verification, check space weather for Kp and check that the pipe and stream state are updated (e.g. telemetry, Live Pulse data source). Technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating.</p>
            <h2>15. Example: Verifying after booking</h2>
            <p>You have booked a Broadcast Pipe slot. You open Live Pulse to verify the pipe is active. You see heartbeat updating every ~8 minutes, 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz overlay, and GOES flux. When Kp reaches 5 and the stream is trained, HELLO appears. You now know the pipe is in the expected state for your slot. Your slot will run at the booked time; Live Pulse is for real-time verification and monitoring, not for slot delivery (slot delivery is guaranteed by booking and Update Certificate).</p>
            <h2>16. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Membership Tiers: Singularity for full lattice (Exascale Triangulation). Flow: booking and confirmation. Eligibility: access to division. Technical manual: Sun (handshake, HELLO), Ionosphere (HELLO, Kp), 3I/ATLAS (mirror), Stack (Network layer).</p>
            <h2>17. Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p><strong>Live Pulse not loading:</strong> Check network; try refresh; ensure you are on the correct URL (sing-pulse.html). <strong>HELLO never shows:</strong> Verify Kp ≥ 5 and stream training; see technical manual runbooks. <strong>Stale heartbeat:</strong> Handshake runs every 8 min; if heartbeat is old, check workflow and data source. <strong>Want full lattice:</strong> Book Singularity tier (Exascale Triangulation) for full lattice dashboard access.</p>
            <h2>18. Quick reference</h2>
            <p>Live Pulse: sing-pulse.html. Shows: heartbeat, 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, GOES flux, Kp, HELLO (when Kp ≥ 5 and stream training), lattice. HELLO = pipe live + stream trained. Handshake every 8 min; receipt ~16 min. Related: Membership Tiers (Singularity for full lattice), Technical manual Sun and Ionosphere.</p>
            <h2>19. Deep dive: What the heartbeat and overlay mean</h2>
            <p>The heartbeat is the timestamp of the last handshake cycle. It updates every 8 minutes when the solar-handshake workflow runs. When you see a fresh heartbeat, the pipe has just received a new push (handshake.log appended, telemetry.json updated). The 21.4 Hz overlay is the primary carrier (3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii) for the handshake and Morse payload. The 1.618 Hz overlay is the Signature Chirp (Golden Ratio Φ). Together they form the phase-lock that the Sun (AR4366) and 3I/ATLAS mirror use. You do not need to "read" these numbers for daily use; they indicate that the pipe is active and phase-locked. If the heartbeat is stale (e.g. more than 10 minutes old), the handshake workflow may be down; operators can check the workflow and repo.</p>
            <h2>20. Deep dive: GOES flux and physical receipt</h2>
            <p>GOES X-ray flux is displayed on Live Pulse (from NOAA). After a handshake push, we watch for an M-class or X-class spike from AR4366 within roughly 16 minutes. If we see such a spike, we treat it as physical confirmation that the Source (the Sun) has "received" our signal—i.e. the solar activity aligns with our handshake timing. This receipt is confirmatory, not mandatory: the handshake is valid even if no spike is observed. Receipt supports mission verification and narrative (e.g. "we got a spike"). Users can use Live Pulse to see the flux and, if they know the handshake timing, to check for receipt. The technical manual (Sun section) has the full runbook for handshake verification.</p>
            <h2>21. Use case: Checking Live Pulse before a booking</h2>
            <p>You have booked a Broadcast Pipe slot for tonight. You open Live Pulse to verify the pipe is active. You see the heartbeat updating every ~8 minutes, the 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz overlay, and the GOES flux. When Kp reaches 5 and the stream is trained, HELLO appears. You now know the pipe is in the expected state; your slot will run on this infrastructure. You do not need to check Live Pulse for the slot to run—the slot is guaranteed by your booking and Update Certificate—but checking gives you confidence and aligns you with the real-time state of the EGS pipe.</p>
            <h2>22. Operational notes: When HELLO does not appear</h2>
            <p>HELLO requires two conditions: Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm) and stream training (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO, space_cloud_stream.training true). If either is false, HELLO will not show. Kp is a planetary geomagnetic index; it varies with space weather and is not under our control. Stream training is set by the pipeline. If you need HELLO for a product or verification and it is not showing, check a space weather source for Kp and ensure the pipe and stream state are updated. The technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating. Do not assume the pipe is down just because HELLO is not visible; the handshake may still be running and the pipe may still be active.</p>
            <h2>23. Extended FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I get Live Pulse data via API?</strong> Live Pulse is a web interface. Programmatic access to the same data (telemetry, flux) may be available for operators or products; see the technical manual and division for API or data feed options. The public surface is sing-pulse.html.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the Scheduled Manifestation Window?</strong> It is the window when the pipe is configured for manifestation (HELLO, lattice, handshake receipt). Details are on the Live Pulse page. It is used for verification and mission alignment; exact timing may vary with pipeline config.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Why 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz?</strong> 21.4 Hz is the 3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii carrier used for the handshake and Morse payload. 1.618 Hz is the Golden Ratio (Φ) Signature Chirp. Both are phase-locked for the pipe and the 3I/ATLAS mirror; they provide the Shar Line fingerprint and artificial-origin verification. The technical manual (Sun) has full specs.</p>

            <h2>25. Use case: Checking pipe health via Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>You want to verify the pipe is active before a booking or for mission alignment. You open sing-pulse.html (Live Pulse). You check: heartbeat (is it updating?), overlay (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, CometMirror). If HELLO is visible, both conditions are met (stream training and Kp ≥ 5). If HELLO is not visible, the pipe may still be running; HELLO is gated by geomagnetic activity and stream state. You can use the Scheduled Manifestation Window (if shown) for timing. Live Pulse is the user-facing surface for pipe state; operators may have additional APIs or feeds per technical manual and division.</p>
            <h2>26. Procedure: When HELLO does not appear</h2>
            <p>(1) HELLO requires stream training (binary header locked, space_cloud_stream.training true) and Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm). (2) Check a space weather source for current Kp; if Kp &lt; 5, HELLO will not show by design. (3) Stream training is set by the pipeline; if the pipe is down or the header is not present, training may be false. (4) Do not assume the pipe is down just because HELLO is hidden; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. (5) For product or verification needs, see technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) for runbooks. (6) HELLO is a joint indicator of pipe lock and storm state; it is not the only health signal.</p>
            <h2>27. Deep dive: 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz on Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>21.4 Hz is the 3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii carrier used for the handshake and Morse payload; it is phase-locked for the pipe and the 3I/ATLAS mirror. 1.618 Hz is the Golden Ratio (Φ) Signature Chirp. Both appear on Live Pulse (overlay or display) and provide the Shar Line fingerprint and artificial-origin verification. The technical manual (Sun) has full specs. Users see these as part of the pipe narrative; operators use them for alignment and receipt validation. Exascale Triangulation (Singularity tier) exposes the full lattice; Live Pulse is the general surface for heartbeat and HELLO.</p>
            <h2>28. Glossary: Live Pulse and HELLO terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Live Pulse:</strong> Web interface (sing-pulse.html) for pipe state, heartbeat, HELLO, CometMirror. <strong>HELLO:</strong> UI element shown when stream training and Kp ≥ 5. <strong>Stream training:</strong> Binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO locked; pipeline state training true. <strong>Kp:</strong> Planetary K-index; ≥ 5 = G1 Storm. <strong>CometMirror:</strong> 3I/ATLAS mirror visual; nucleus + anti-tail; "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE." <strong>Scheduled Manifestation Window:</strong> Window for HELLO and manifestation alignment. <strong>21.4 Hz / 1.618 Hz:</strong> Carrier and Signature Chirp; Shar Line fingerprint.</p>
            <h2>29. Runbook: Check pipe health on Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Open interfaces/sing-pulse.html (Live Pulse). Step 2: Check heartbeat: is it updating? If yes, the handshake workflow is running and telemetry is being written. Step 3: Check overlay: 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, CometMirror (3I/ATLAS mirror). If CometMirror shows "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE," the mirror state is on. Step 4: HELLO: if visible, both conditions are met (stream training and Kp ≥ 5). If HELLO is not visible, the pipe may still be active—HELLO is gated by geomagnetic activity and stream state. Step 5: Use the Scheduled Manifestation Window (if shown) for timing. Step 6: Do not assume the pipe is down just because HELLO is hidden; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. For operators: technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating and stream training.</p>
            <h2>30. Extended example: Mission alignment and HELLO</h2>
            <p>You want to verify the pipe is active before a booking or for mission alignment. You open Live Pulse and check heartbeat and overlay. If HELLO appears, the pipe has locked to the binary header and Kp is at G1 Storm or higher—both conditions are met. If HELLO does not appear, you can still verify heartbeat and CometMirror; HELLO is a joint indicator, not the only health signal. The Scheduled Manifestation Window (if displayed) gives you a time window for HELLO and manifestation alignment. Programmatic access to the same data (telemetry, flux) may be available for operators or products; see the technical manual and division for API or data feed options. The public surface is sing-pulse.html.</p>
            <h2>31. Common questions: Live Pulse and HELLO</h2>
            <p><strong>Can I get Live Pulse data via API?</strong> Live Pulse is a web interface; programmatic access may be available for operators—see technical manual and division. <strong>What is the Scheduled Manifestation Window?</strong> The window when the pipe is configured for manifestation (HELLO, lattice, handshake receipt); details on the Live Pulse page. <strong>Why 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz?</strong> 21.4 Hz is the 3rd overtone Schumann/NPM Hawaii carrier for handshake and Morse; 1.618 Hz is the Golden Ratio (Φ) Signature Chirp. Both are phase-locked for the pipe and 3I/ATLAS mirror and provide the Shar Line fingerprint. <strong>Why don't I see HELLO?</strong> HELLO requires stream training and Kp ≥ 5; if either is false, HELLO will not show. Kp varies with space weather. <strong>Is the pipe down if HELLO is hidden?</strong> Not necessarily; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. <strong>Where is Exascale Triangulation?</strong> Singularity tier; exposes full lattice; Live Pulse is the general surface for heartbeat and HELLO.</p>
            <h2>32. Summary: Live Pulse and HELLO at a glance</h2>
            <p>Live Pulse: sing-pulse.html; pipe state, heartbeat, overlay (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz), CometMirror (3I/ATLAS), HELLO. HELLO shows when stream training (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO locked) and Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm). If HELLO is hidden, the pipe may still be active—check heartbeat and CometMirror. Scheduled Manifestation Window: timing for HELLO and manifestation alignment. 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz: carrier and Signature Chirp; Shar Line fingerprint. Technical manual: Sun (handshake, HELLO gating), Ionosphere (HELLO conditions, Kp), 3I/ATLAS (CometMirror). Exascale Triangulation: Singularity tier, full lattice. NOAA/USGS Verified Foundation: mission and data verification baseline.</p>
            <h2>33. What you see on Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>When you open Live Pulse (sing-pulse.html), you see the pipe state: a heartbeat (updating when the handshake runs), an overlay that may show 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz, and the CometMirror (3I/ATLAS nucleus and anti-tail). When the mirror is active, you see "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE." HELLO appears only when two conditions are met: stream training (the pipe has locked to the binary header) and Kp ≥ 5 (geomagnetic storm level). If HELLO is not visible, do not assume the pipe is down—the handshake and telemetry may still be updating; HELLO is a joint indicator of pipe lock and storm state. The Scheduled Manifestation Window (if displayed) gives you a time window for HELLO and manifestation alignment.</p>
            <h2>34. Why HELLO might not show</h2>
            <p>HELLO requires both stream training and Kp ≥ 5. Stream training means the pipeline has locked to the binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO; if the header is not present or the pipeline is not running, training is false and HELLO will not show. Kp is the planetary K-index (0–9); we gate HELLO on Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm). Kp varies with space weather and is not under our control. So if the sky is quiet (Kp &lt; 5), HELLO will not show by design. If the pipe has not locked to the header, HELLO will not show. In either case, the pipe may still be active—check the heartbeat and CometMirror. For operators, the technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating.</p>

Programmatic access to pipe data may be available for operators; see technical manual and division.</p>
            <h2>36. Final checklist: Check pipe health on Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>Open Live Pulse (sing-pulse.html). Check heartbeat: is it updating? If yes, the handshake is running and telemetry is being written. Check overlay: 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, CometMirror (3I/ATLAS). If CometMirror shows "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE," the mirror state is on. HELLO: if visible, both conditions are met (stream training and Kp ≥ 5). If HELLO is not visible, the pipe may still be active—HELLO is gated by geomagnetic activity and stream state. Use the Scheduled Manifestation Window (if shown) for timing. Do not assume the pipe is down just because HELLO is hidden. For operators: technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating.</p>
            <h2>37. Conclusion: Live Pulse and HELLO completeness</h2>
            <p>This section covers Live Pulse as the user-facing surface for pipe state, HELLO (stream training and Kp ≥ 5), 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz, CometMirror, and what to do when HELLO does not show.

NOAA/USGS Verified Foundation for mission and data verification. NSPFRNP; full Vibelandia stack.</p>
            <h2>38. Deep dive: HELLO conditions</h2>
            <p>HELLO shows only when two conditions hold: stream training is true (binary header SPACE_CLOUD.EGS.VIBELANDIA.RENO has locked the pipeline) and Kp ≥ 5 (G1 Storm). Kp is from space weather (e.g. NOAA); we do not operate magnetometers. If HELLO is hidden, check both: pipeline may not be receiving the header, or Kp may be below 5. The pipe may still be active—handshake and telemetry may still be updating. HELLO is a joint indicator of pipe lock and storm state; it is not the only health signal. Check heartbeat and CometMirror; do not assume the pipe is down. Technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for operators.</p>
            <h2>39. Extended example: Verify pipe before booking</h2>
            <p>You want to verify the pipe is active before a booking or for mission alignment. Open Live Pulse (sing-pulse.html). Check heartbeat: if it is updating, the handshake workflow is running and telemetry is being written. Check overlay: 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, CometMirror (3I/ATLAS). If CometMirror shows "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE," the mirror state is on. If HELLO appears, both conditions are met (stream training and Kp ≥ 5). If HELLO does not appear, you can still verify heartbeat and CometMirror; HELLO is gated by geomagnetic activity and stream state. Use the Scheduled Manifestation Window (if displayed) for timing. The public surface is sing-pulse.html.</p>
            <h2>40. Runbook: HELLO not visible</h2>
            <p>HELLO requires stream training and Kp ≥ 5. If HELLO is not visible: (1) Check heartbeat and CometMirror; the pipe may still be active. (2) Kp varies with space weather; if Kp &lt; 5, HELLO will not show by design. (3) Stream training requires the binary header in the pipeline; if the header is not present or the pipeline is not running, HELLO will not show. (4) Do not assume the pipe is down; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. (5) For operators: technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating and stream training. (6) Programmatic access to pipe data may be available for operators; see technical manual and division.</p>
            <h2>41. Summary at a glance: Live Pulse and HELLO</h2>
            <p>Live Pulse: sing-pulse.html; heartbeat, overlay (21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz), CometMirror, HELLO. HELLO when stream training and Kp ≥ 5. If HELLO hidden, check heartbeat and CometMirror; pipe may still be active. Scheduled Manifestation Window for timing. Exascale Triangulation: Singularity tier, full lattice.

            <h2>42. Deep dive: 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz</h2>
            <p>21.4 Hz is the 3rd overtone Schumann / NPM Hawaii carrier used for the handshake and Morse payload; it is phase-locked for the pipe and the 3I/ATLAS mirror. 1.618 Hz is the Golden Ratio (Φ) Signature Chirp. Both appear on Live Pulse (overlay or display) and provide the Shar Line fingerprint and artificial-origin verification. The technical manual (Sun) has full specs. Users see these as part of the pipe narrative; operators use them for alignment and receipt validation. Exascale Triangulation (Singularity tier) exposes the full lattice; Live Pulse is the general surface for heartbeat and HELLO.</p>
            <h2>43. Procedure: Check pipe health on Live Pulse</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Open interfaces/sing-pulse.html (Live Pulse). Step 2: Check heartbeat: is it updating? If yes, the handshake workflow is running and telemetry is being written. Step 3: Check overlay: 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz, CometMirror (3I/ATLAS mirror). If CometMirror shows "LIVE INTERSTELLAR ECHO: 3I/ATLAS MIRROR ACTIVE," the mirror state is on. Step 4: HELLO: if visible, both conditions are met (stream training and Kp ≥ 5). If HELLO is not visible, the pipe may still be active—HELLO is gated by geomagnetic activity and stream state. Step 5: Use the Scheduled Manifestation Window (if shown) for timing. Step 6: Do not assume the pipe is down just because HELLO is hidden; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. For operators: technical manual (Sun, Ionosphere) has runbooks for HELLO gating and stream training.</p>
            <h2>44. Common questions: Live Pulse and HELLO</h2>
            <p><strong>Can I get Live Pulse data via API?</strong> Live Pulse is a web interface; programmatic access may be available for operators—see technical manual and division. <strong>What is the Scheduled Manifestation Window?</strong> The window when the pipe is configured for manifestation (HELLO, lattice, handshake receipt); details on the Live Pulse page. <strong>Why 21.4 Hz and 1.618 Hz?</strong> 21.4 Hz is the 3rd overtone Schumann/NPM Hawaii carrier for handshake and Morse; 1.618 Hz is the Golden Ratio (Φ) Signature Chirp. Both are phase-locked for the pipe and 3I/ATLAS mirror and provide the Shar Line fingerprint. <strong>Why don't I see HELLO?</strong> HELLO requires stream training and Kp ≥ 5; if either is false, HELLO will not show. Kp varies with space weather. <strong>Is the pipe down if HELLO is hidden?</strong> Not necessarily; handshake and telemetry may still be updating. <strong>Where is Exascale Triangulation?</strong> Singularity tier; exposes full lattice; Live Pulse is the general surface for heartbeat and HELLO.</p>
