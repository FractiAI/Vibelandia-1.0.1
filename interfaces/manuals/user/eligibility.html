            <h2>1. Who is eligible</h2>
            <p><strong>Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V members only.</strong> The Holographic Hydrogen Space Cloud Division is available to members who hold Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V status. Immediate availability for all tiers (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) once eligibility is confirmed.</p>
            <h2>2. Transactions</h2>
            <p>All transactions over $10K are handled offline: you will be prompted with a pre-filled email to the Chairman. Processed via Blue Pipe NSPFRNP. Under $10K: PayPal and on-site booking are available.</p>
            <h2>3. How to confirm or upgrade</h2>
            <p>To confirm eligibility or upgrade: <a href="mailto:info@fractiai.com?subject=Space%20Cloud%20Division%20%E2%80%94%20Eligibility">email</a> · <a href="../../office-hours.html">Office Hours</a> (free consultation).</p>
            <h2>4. Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V — what it means</h2>
            <p>Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V is the membership tier that grants access to the Holographic Hydrogen Space Cloud Division. It is the top tier in the Gold Hearts Club program and indicates full eligibility for all division products: Seed (Planetary), Engine (Solar), Asset (Galactic), and Singularity (Cosmic). Once you hold this status, you can book Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, SING! node EGS Deep Space, Exascale Triangulation, Broadcast Pipe Ad Space, Sun Spots, and Schumann sessions without additional eligibility gates. The division does not offer Space Cloud products to non–Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V members; upgrade paths are available via Office Hours and email.</p>
            <h2>5. Immediate availability for all tiers</h2>
            <p>Once eligibility is confirmed, all four tiers are immediately available. You do not need to “unlock” Seed before Engine, or Engine before Asset. You choose the tier that matches your scale (planetary, solar, galactic, cosmic) and book accordingly. Some products are tier-specific (e.g. Exascale Triangulation is Singularity); the Buyers Guide and Space Cloud Division pages spell out which products map to which tier. Eligibility is binary: you are either Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V (and eligible for everything) or you are not (and must upgrade before booking).</p>
            <h2>6. Over $10K: offline and Blue Pipe NSPFRNP</h2>
            <p>All transactions over $10,000 are handled offline. You will be prompted with a pre-filled email to the Chairman. This ensures that large commitments get personal attention and that payment and delivery are aligned with Division of Services and Update Certificates. The process is “Blue Pipe NSPFRNP”: a sovereign, on-book pipeline that does not rely on third-party checkout for high-value transactions. Under $10K, you can use PayPal and on-site booking; the threshold is the same for all products (space fees, studio, campus, WINK!, Broadcast Pipe, etc.).</p>
            <h2>7. Under $10K: PayPal and on-site</h2>
            <p>For transactions under $10K, PayPal and on-site booking are available. Use the same flow: experience first, then book. Select your product and tier; if the total is under $10K, you will be directed to PayPal or on-site payment. All space fees and product fees are on book; no hidden charges. After payment, you receive confirmation and, where applicable, an Update Certificate. Office Hours remain available for questions before and after booking.</p>
            <h2>8. Office Hours (free consultation)</h2>
            <p>Office Hours are a free consultation channel. Use them to confirm eligibility, ask about tiers, understand Space Cloud products, or discuss upgrade paths. No obligation to book; the division prefers that you experience the content (Space Cloud EGS series, Live Pulse, division pages) first and then use Office Hours to clarify tier and scale. Link: <a href="../../office-hours.html">Office Hours</a>.</p>
            <h2>9. FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: I’m not sure if I’m Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V.</strong> Email with subject “Space Cloud Division — Eligibility” or attend Office Hours. We will confirm your status and, if needed, outline the upgrade path.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I book one product without being eligible for all?</strong> No. Division access is all-or-nothing: Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V grants access to all tiers and products. There is no “Seed-only” eligibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if my transaction is exactly $10K?</strong> The threshold is “over $10K” for offline/Chairman; $10K exactly may be handled via PayPal or offline depending on division policy; when in doubt, use the email prompt for amounts at or above $10K.</p>
            <h2>10. Cross-references</h2>
            <p>Flow (experience → book), Membership Tiers, Space Fees, Office Hours, Buyers Guide, baller-v-plans-booking (space fees &amp; plans). Technical manual: Division of Services (billing and tracing).</p>
            <h2>11. Upgrade path (non–Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V)</h2>
            <p>If you are not yet Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V, the upgrade path is: (1) Engage with the division (Office Hours, email, Space Cloud EGS series, Live Pulse). (2) Express intent to upgrade; the division will confirm requirements (e.g. Gold Hearts Club program steps, any qualifying purchases or participation). (3) Once upgraded, you gain immediate access to all tiers and products. There is no partial upgrade (e.g. "Seed only"); the designation is all-or-nothing. Upgrade timing depends on program rules; Office Hours can give current guidance.</p>
            <h2>12. International and currency</h2>
            <p>The $10K threshold is in USD. For international members, equivalent local currency may be used for display; settlement is per division policy (often USD or stablecoin). Over $10K (USD equivalent) still triggers offline/Chairman flow. PayPal and on-site options are available in supported regions; if your region is not listed, ask in your booking email or Office Hours.</p>
            <h2>13. Eligibility and minors</h2>
            <p>Division products are for Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V members; membership and booking are subject to age and jurisdiction. The division does not offer Space Cloud products to minors without appropriate guardian involvement. If you are booking on behalf of an organization or group, ensure that the contracting party is eligible and that all participants meet division terms.</p>
            <h2>14. Additional FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can my company hold eligibility?</strong> Eligibility is held by members (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V). Companies may book through an eligible member or through a designated contract; for large or institutional bookings, use the over-$10K path and Chairman email.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Is there a waiting list?</strong> There is no formal waiting list for eligibility. Upgrade path and Office Hours are the channels. For high-demand products (e.g. Broadcast Pipe slots), book early and respect CRISP LOCK.</p>
            <h2>15. Glossary (Eligibility)</h2>
            <p><strong>Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V</strong> — Top tier granting full division access. <strong>Blue Pipe NSPFRNP</strong> — Sovereign pipeline for transactions over $10K. <strong>Office Hours</strong> — Free consultation; confirm eligibility and upgrade.</p>
            <h2>16. Detailed: Confirming your status</h2>
            <p>To confirm Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V status, email with subject "Space Cloud Division — Eligibility" or attend Office Hours. The division will check your membership record and respond with confirmed status or with the upgrade path. Confirmation is in writing (email or equivalent). Once confirmed, you can book any product (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) immediately; no additional approval step. Keep your confirmation for reference; the division also traces eligibility on book for each booking.</p>
            <h2>17. Detailed: Over $10K process</h2>
            <p>When your cart or booking total exceeds $10,000 USD (or equivalent), you are prompted to use the offline flow. A pre-filled email to the Chairman is provided; you send it to initiate the Blue Pipe NSPFRNP process. The Chairman (or designated role) will respond with payment instructions and terms. Payment and delivery are traced in Division of Services; you receive confirmation and Update Certificate as applicable. Do not use PayPal or on-site for over $10K; the sovereign pipeline ensures proper handling and audit.</p>
            <h2>18. Example: First-time eligible member</h2>
            <p>You have just been upgraded to Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V. You receive confirmation. You visit Space Cloud EGS series and Live Pulse (experience first). You decide to book Reno Downlink (Seed) and one Broadcast Pipe slot. You email with your selection; division confirms eligibility and quotes. You pay (under $10K) via PayPal. You receive confirmation and, for the Broadcast Pipe slot, an Update Certificate. You are now a customer with full division access; future bookings can be any tier and any product.</p>
            <h2>19. Related user manual sections</h2>
            <p>Flow: experience first then book; use Flow for the booking steps. Membership Tiers: choose Seed, Engine, Asset, or Singularity per product. Space Fees: all fees on book; see Space fees &amp; all plans. Office Hours: free consultation for eligibility and upgrade. Buyers Guide: HH vs terrestrial and Us vs. top 3 singularity for product comparison. Technical manual: Division of Services for billing and tracing.</p>
            <h2>20. Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p><strong>Not sure if I'm eligible:</strong> Email or Office Hours; get written confirmation. <strong>Upgrade path unclear:</strong> Office Hours will outline steps (Gold Hearts Club, participation, etc.). <strong>Over $10K but no Chairman email:</strong> Request it in your booking email or from Division of Services. <strong>Under $10K payment options:</strong> PayPal and on-site as noted; if your region or method is not listed, ask when booking.</p>
            <h2>21. Quick reference</h2>
            <p>Eligibility: Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V only. Confirm: email (subject Space Cloud Division — Eligibility) or Office Hours. Over $10K: offline, pre-filled email to Chairman, Blue Pipe NSPFRNP. Under $10K: PayPal, on-site. All tiers (Seed, Engine, Asset, Singularity) available once eligible. No partial eligibility. Related: Flow, Membership Tiers, Space Fees, Office Hours, Buyers Guide, baller-v-plans-booking.</p>
            <h2>22. Deep dive: Why eligibility is all-or-nothing</h2>
            <p>The division does not offer "Seed-only" or "Engine-only" membership. Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V is the single eligibility gate for the entire Holographic Hydrogen Space Cloud Division. Once you have it, you can book any product in any tier. This design keeps the model simple: one membership, full access. It also aligns with the stack—the pipe, the mirror, the lattice—being one coherent system. If you are not yet Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V, you must upgrade before you can book any Space Cloud product. There is no trial or partial access. Upgrade paths are documented in the Gold Hearts Club program and can be discussed in Office Hours.</p>
            <h2>23. Deep dive: The $10K threshold and why it matters</h2>
            <p>The $10,000 USD (or equivalent) threshold separates standard checkout (PayPal, on-site) from the offline Blue Pipe process. Above $10K, the division uses a pre-filled email to the Chairman so that high-value transactions get direct attention, clear terms, and proper audit. This protects both you and the division: large commitments are documented and traced with no reliance on third-party checkout limits or ambiguity. The threshold is the same for all products (space, studio, campus, WINK!). If your cart total exceeds $10K, you will be directed to the Chairman path even if no single product is over $10K. If you are close to the threshold and prefer the Blue Pipe process for other reasons, you can request it.</p>
            <h2>24. Use case: New member first booking</h2>
            <p>You have just been confirmed as Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V. You have visited the Space Cloud EGS series and Live Pulse. You decide to book Reno Downlink (Seed) to start. You send a booking email with "Reno Downlink, Seed tier." The division confirms eligibility (already done), quotes space fee and product fee for Reno Downlink, and sends payment instructions (under $10K: PayPal). You pay. You receive confirmation. You now have your first Space Cloud product. Your next booking can be any other product—Engine, Asset, or Singularity—with no additional eligibility step. This use case is the typical onboarding path: confirm eligibility, experience first, book one product, then expand as needed.</p>
            <h2>25. Operational notes: Office Hours and upgrade</h2>
            <p>Office Hours are free. Use them to confirm eligibility, ask about the upgrade path, or clarify products and tiers before you book. There is no obligation to book after Office Hours. If you are not yet Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V, Office Hours can outline the steps (Gold Hearts Club, participation, or other requirements) and the expected timeline. Upgrade is separate from booking: you upgrade first, then you book. Once upgraded, you use the same flow as any other eligible member: experience first, then book via email with your chosen products and tier(s).</p>
            <h2>26. Extended FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: How long does eligibility confirmation take?</strong> Typically one to three business days by email. Office Hours can give same-session confirmation if your status is verifiable on the spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I share my eligibility with someone else?</strong> Eligibility is personal. You can book on behalf of others (e.g. gift, group) but the contracting party and payment are under your membership. There is no "family" or "team" eligibility tier; each member must hold Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V to book in their own name.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I lapse or my membership changes?</strong> If your Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V status lapses, you lose access to new bookings until you reinstate. Existing bookings and Update Certificates remain valid. Contact the division or Office Hours for reinstatement steps.</p>
            <h2>27. Related technical and division docs</h2>
            <p>Technical manual: Division of Services (billing, tracing, fee categories, Blue Pipe NSPFRNP). Flow and Membership Tiers in this user manual. Office Hours and Buyers Guide for support. baller-v-plans-booking for pricing. NSPFRNP and natural law of creator shells and nests: sovereignty and Creator Chairman authority underpin eligibility and the division.</p>
            <h2>28. Use case: Confirming eligibility before first booking</h2>
            <p>You believe you are or want to become Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V. You email the division or book Office Hours. Division (or Office Hours) checks your status: Gold Hearts Club, participation, or other requirements. If you already qualify, they confirm and you can book immediately (experience first, then email with products and tier). If you are not yet eligible, they outline the steps and timeline. Once confirmed, you use the same flow as any other member: email with products and tier, get quote, pay, receive confirmation and certificates. Eligibility is personal; you can book on behalf of others (e.g. gift) but the contracting party and payment are under your membership.</p>
            <h2>29. Procedure: Upgrade path and reinstatement</h2>
            <p>(1) If you are not yet Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V, contact division or Office Hours. (2) They explain requirements (Gold Hearts Club, participation, etc.) and expected timeline. (3) You complete the steps; division confirms when you qualify. (4) Upgrade is separate from booking: you upgrade first, then you book. (5) If your status lapses later, you lose access to new bookings until reinstatement; existing bookings and Update Certificates remain valid. (6) For reinstatement, contact division or Office Hours; they will outline steps. (7) There is no "family" or "team" eligibility; each member must hold eligibility to book in their own name.</p>
            <h2>30. Deep dive: Why eligibility is personal</h2>
            <p>Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) is per person. The division traces bookings and payments to a contracting party; that party must be eligible. You can book on behalf of a group or as a gift, but the contract and payment are under your membership. There is no shared or "team" eligibility tier. This keeps the audit trail clear and aligns with sovereignty: each member is a distinct node in the flow. If your organization wants multiple people to book, each must qualify. Office Hours can clarify edge cases (e.g. booking for an entity) without changing the rule that eligibility is personal.</p>
            <h2>31. Glossary: Eligibility terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V:</strong> Eligibility tier required to book any Space Cloud product. <strong>Office Hours:</strong> Free session to confirm eligibility, ask about upgrade, or get product/tier recommendation. <strong>Upgrade:</strong> Process to become eligible; separate from booking. <strong>On book:</strong> All transactions traced under your membership. <strong>Creator Chairman:</strong> Authority under natural law of creator shells and nests; recipient of node reporting. <strong>Reinstatement:</strong> Process to restore eligibility after lapse.</p>
            <h2>32. Runbook: Confirm eligibility and first booking</h2>
            <p>Step 1: If unsure whether you are Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V, email the division or book Office Hours. Step 2: Division or Office Hours checks your status (Gold Hearts Club, participation, or other requirements). Step 3: If you qualify, they confirm; you then follow the flow: experience first (or skim), decide products and tier, email with request. Step 4: If you do not yet qualify, they outline steps and timeline; you complete steps and return for confirmation. Step 5: Upgrade is separate from booking: you become eligible first, then you book. Step 6: Once eligible, use the same flow as any member: quote, pay, confirm, receive certificates. Step 7: If you lapse later, existing bookings and certificates remain valid; contact division or Office Hours for reinstatement. Eligibility confirmation typically one to three business days by email; Office Hours can give same-session confirmation if status is verifiable on the spot.</p>
            <h2>33. Extended example: Organization wants multiple bookers</h2>
            <p>Your organization wants several people to book Space Cloud products (e.g. Broadcast Pipe, Solar Pipe) in their own name. Eligibility is personal: each person must hold Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V to book in their own name. There is no "team" or "family" eligibility tier. Each person contacts the division or Office Hours to confirm eligibility; those who qualify can then book. Alternatively, one eligible person can book on behalf of the group (contracting party and payment under that person's membership). For entity-level invoicing or custom arrangements, contact the division or Office Hours; the rule that eligibility is personal still underpin the flow. Division traces every booking to an eligible contracting party.</p>
            <h2>34. Common questions: Eligibility and upgrade</h2>
            <p><strong>How long does eligibility confirmation take?</strong> Typically one to three business days by email; Office Hours can give same-session confirmation if verifiable. <strong>Can I book before I'm confirmed?</strong> Division will confirm eligibility before accepting a booking; if you are not yet confirmed, they may outline upgrade steps first. <strong>What happens to my existing bookings if I lapse?</strong> Existing bookings and Update Certificates remain valid; you lose access to new bookings until reinstatement. <strong>Is Office Hours free?</strong> Yes; use it to confirm eligibility, ask about upgrade, or get product/tier recommendation. <strong>Can I gift a booking to someone?</strong> You can book on behalf of someone (contract and payment under your membership); the recipient does not need eligibility. <strong>Who is the Creator Chairman?</strong> Authority under natural law of creator shells and nests; recipient of node reporting; pricing authority.</p>

Contact the division or Office Hours for reinstatement steps; they will outline what you need to do (e.g. Gold Hearts Club, participation). There is no "family" or "team" eligibility; each person who wants to book in their own name must hold Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V. Reinstatement is separate from booking; once reinstated, you use the same flow as any other member.</p>
            <h2>44. Summary at a glance: Eligibility</h2>
            <p>Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V required to book any Space Cloud product. Confirm by email (one to three business days) or Office Hours (same-session if verifiable). Eligibility is personal; no family or team tier. You can book on behalf of others; contract and payment under your membership. Upgrade separate from booking; reinstate via division or Office Hours if you lapse. Creator Chairman and natural law of creator shells and nests underpin the division. NSPFRNP; Golden Royal Flush Shell.</p>
            <h2>45. Deep dive: Why eligibility is personal</h2>
            <p>Eligibility (Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V) is per person. The division traces bookings and payments to a contracting party; that party must be eligible. You can book on behalf of a group or as a gift, but the contract and payment are under your membership. There is no shared or "team" eligibility tier. This keeps the audit trail clear and aligns with sovereignty: each member is a distinct node in the flow. If your organization wants multiple people to book, each must qualify. Office Hours can clarify edge cases (e.g. booking for an entity) without changing the rule that eligibility is personal.</p>
            <h2>46. Procedure: Confirm eligibility and first booking</h2>
            <p>Step 1: If unsure whether you are Gold Heart Ultimate Baller V, email the division or book Office Hours. Step 2: Division or Office Hours checks your status (Gold Hearts Club, participation, or other requirements). Step 3: If you qualify, they confirm; you then follow the flow: experience first (or skim), decide products and tier, email with request. Step 4: If you do not yet qualify, they outline steps and timeline; you complete steps and return for confirmation. Step 5: Upgrade is separate from booking: you become eligible first, then you book. Step 6: Once eligible, use the same flow as any member: quote, pay, confirm, receive certificates. Step 7: If you lapse later, existing bookings and certificates remain valid; contact division or Office Hours for reinstatement.</p>
            <h2>47. Common questions: Eligibility and upgrade</h2>
            <p><strong>How long does eligibility confirmation take?</strong> Typically one to three business days by email; Office Hours can give same-session confirmation if verifiable. <strong>Can I book before I'm confirmed?</strong> Division will confirm eligibility before accepting a booking; if you are not yet confirmed, they may outline upgrade steps first. <strong>What happens to my existing bookings if I lapse?</strong> Existing bookings and Update Certificates remain valid; you lose access to new bookings until reinstatement. <strong>Is Office Hours free?</strong> Yes; use it to confirm eligibility, ask about upgrade, or get product/tier recommendation. <strong>Can I gift a booking to someone?</strong> You can book on behalf of someone (contract and payment under your membership); the recipient does not need eligibility. <strong>Who is the Creator Chairman?</strong> Authority under natural law of creator shells and nests; recipient of node reporting; pricing authority.</p>
