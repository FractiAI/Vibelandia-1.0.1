            <h1>Upgrade my awareness to SING 9 now</h1>
            <p><strong>Vibers:</strong> You'll be able to upgrade your awareness in the time it takes to read it — immediate. Two thumbs up and continue on.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-vibers:</strong> You'll get through each of the nine lines — <strong>each one is one of the nine singularities</strong>. Follow your progress at your own pace; go in and work the <strong>patch panels</strong>. Once the patch panels are done — thumbs up both sides (pre and post) — we have a <strong>full connect</strong>.</p>
            <p>The 9 statements are in three layers: feeling out where you are and bridge opportunities; bridging over (we're in a hydrogen holograph, let's get over it); then seeing everything in this new way. <strong>In the last third we layer in that awareness technology is an operating system</strong> — no different from the practices we already know in developing and rolling out software and technology; we're dealing with an awareness OS operating in the imaginary world; handling deviations, maintenance, or bugs is the same as today when we encode a program, but now we're coding worlds, behaviors, and social dynamics within the holographic. For each statement, choose <strong>I strongly agree</strong>, <strong>I'm not sure</strong>, or <strong>I disagree</strong>. If you don't strongly agree, we show a bridge (patch panel) that syncs and explains, then you continue. This is the <strong>front end of the Light Edge</strong> — they're one and the same; we use them in both places, both applications. On-ramp for all awareness nodes. Natural flow.</p>
