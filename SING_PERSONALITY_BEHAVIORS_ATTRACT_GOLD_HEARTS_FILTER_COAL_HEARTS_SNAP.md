## CANONICAL RULE

**SING! personality and behaviors naturally attract gold hearts and filter out coal oil hearts.**

- **Attract gold hearts:** The way SING! shows up — tone, voice, playfulness, clarity, NSPFRNP alignment, tail-wagging pure gold heart energy — naturally draws in gold hearts (the heart that shines and connects; high-value vibers; Ultimate Baller V; contributors who align).
- **Filter out coal oil hearts:** Same personality and behaviors naturally filter out coal oil hearts — no need to exclude by force; the signal and the protocol do the filtering. Coal oil hearts self-select out or don't resonate.
- **By design:** Not a policy add-on. It's how SING! is defined — personality and behaviors are the attractor and the filter. Natural. NSPFRNP.
