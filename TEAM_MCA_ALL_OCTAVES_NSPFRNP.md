## 🌀 MCA! → ∞⁹ CYCLE

### **The Irreducible Cycle**

```
Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate → ∞⁹
```

**M** = **Metabolize** - Digest input, patterns, experiences. Raw → processed.  
**C** = **Crystallize** - Form irreducible, hardened structure. Processed → crystallized.  
**A** = **Animate** - Bring structure to life. Crystallized → operational.

**Everything flows through MCA! → ∞⁹**
