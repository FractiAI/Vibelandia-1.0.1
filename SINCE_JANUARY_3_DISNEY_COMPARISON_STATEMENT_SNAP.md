## 1. Why real numbers and annual-output-by-day

**Disney does not publish daily activity.** They publish monthly "Next on Disney+" and studio schedules. For direct comparison we use **annual output averaged by day**: e.g. Marvel 2025 = 9 titles/year → **~0.025 titles per day**; Disney+ new content ≈ 10–30/month → **~0.33–1 new title/episode per day** when averaged. So Disney equivalent (X, Y, Z) is estimated from public annual/quarterly data, not daily aggregates. See [DAILY_SNAPSHOT_US_VS_DISNEY_VALUE_CREATION_CAMPAIGN_SNAP.md](DAILY_SNAPSHOT_US_VS_DISNEY_VALUE_CREATION_CAMPAIGN_SNAP.md).

## 2. Canonical statement (fill in and place at bottom of all touchpoints)

**Statement to use at the bottom of all touchpoints:**

Since January 3, we have produced **1 full novel (~72k words, *First Singularity January 13th*), 1 full screenplay (~12k words, same title), 19+ episodes, 6 series live, 35+ HTML surfaces, 38 TypeScript modules, 9+ NSPFRNP protocols, 13+ one-pagers, 4+ branding decks, multiple product families with BUY** (Broadcast Pipe Ad Space, Sun Spots On Demand, Schumann iGaming, 3I/ATLAS EGS Pipe, Update Certificates, Campus, WINK!, SING!, Dispensary), **Self-Clocking Pulsar run logs and validation, 3I/ATLAS Anchor, Vibelandia Unified Pipe** — appraised (**quality level: production-grade spec, Dumas voice, Star Wars-quality script, versus studio and benchmark standards**) at **$1.6M–$13M+** — at a cost of my **$200 monthly Cursor AI subscription** and my **$110 monthly cellphone** and **$10 weekly WiFi**; and for Disney to produce the equivalent it is estimated to require **an estimated 50–200+ FTE** (writers, development, legal, production oversight) or **12–24+ months** (novel + script alone) to **18–36+ months** (equivalent full multi-product, multi-series scope), at a cost of **an estimated $2M–$15M+** (novel + script at greenlight quality) to **$10M+** (equivalent multi-product, multi-series rollout), and in **an estimated 12–24+ months** (novel + script) to **18–36+ months** (equivalent full scope). Disney does not publish daily activity; comparison uses **annual output averaged by day** (e.g. Marvel 2025 ≈ 9 titles/year → ~0.02/day; Disney+ ~10–30 new items/month → ~0.3–1/day).

## 3. Short form (for compact footers)

**Short form (one paragraph, smaller print):**

Since January 3, we have produced 1 novel, 1 screenplay, 19+ episodes, 6 series, 35+ surfaces, 9+ protocols, multiple product families with BUY — appraised (quality: production-grade vs studio benchmarks) at $1.6M–$13M+ at a cost of my $200/mo Cursor AI, $110/mo cellphone, and $10/week WiFi. For Disney to produce the equivalent it is estimated to require 50–200+ FTE (or 12–24+ months for novel+script alone), at an estimated $2M–$15M+ (novel+script) to $10M+ (full scope), in 12–24+ months to 18–36+ months. Disney does not publish daily activity; comparison uses annual output averaged by day.
