# 🪟 Window Gate Sensor Structure Snap
## Floating State • Cracked Window • Curtain-Flow Sensor Trigger → Metabolize → Crystallize → Re-Animate

**Snap ID:** `WINDOW-GATE-SENSOR-STRUCTURE-SNAP-V1`  
**Type:** Experience Snap / Sensor Architecture / Floating State / Many-Ways Config  
**Status:** ⚡ SNAPPED - Captured from emergence from sleep  
**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP Sensor Trigger → Metabolize → Crystallize → Re-Animate

## 🎯 EXPERIENCE CONTEXT

**Trying to stay in my floating state. I emerged from sleep.**

**Windows are capturing right now the dynamic of this.**

Experience similarities: the room, the crack, the lever, the curtain strips—all acting as a **new, very config in many ways** sensor-trigger system that feeds the NSPFRNP boot sequence.

## 🪟 WINDOW GATE SENSOR STRUCTURE

### Physical Architecture

```yaml
WINDOW GATE SENSOR STRUCTURE:
├─ Window: Slightly cracked open
│  ├─ Crack: Degree of opening (configurable)
│  ├─ Function: Boundary between inside/outside
│  └─ Role: Gateway for flow, light, sound, touch
│
├─ Lever Mechanism (slide / rotate / hang)
│  ├─ Open: Lever opens → turns → rotates
│  ├─ Close: Lever closes → returns
│  ├─ Left/Right: Collapse or deploy
│  ├─ Deploy / Not deploy: Allow degree of movement
│  └─ State: One little lever in it — full control of gate
│
├─ Captured Device (movement sensor)
│  ├─ Input: Any movement outside the window + at the crack
│  ├─ Function: Sense, capture, detect
│  ├─ Output: Adjust to our needs (feedback loop)
│  └─ Role: Sensor trigger for metabolize → crystallize → reanimate
│
└─ Hanging Curtain Strips
   ├─ State: Waiting to move
   ├─ Trigger: Touch-affected by flow in or out through the crack
   ├─ Role: Secondary sensor — flow made visible/tactile
   └─ Feedback: Strips move → flow registered → config can follow
```

## 🔄 SENSOR TRIGGER → METABOLIZE → CRYSTALLIZE → RE-ANIMATE

### Many-Ways Config

**This is a new, very config in many ways: sensor trigger → metabolize → crystallize → reanimate.**

```yaml
SENSOR TRIGGER:
├─ Movement outside window → captured device
├─ Flow through crack (in/out) → curtain strips move, touch-affected
├─ Lever position (crack degree, deploy/collapse) → gate state
└─ All inputs: Feed the boot sequence

METABOLIZE:
├─ Patterns from outside (wind, sound, light, presence)
├─ Patterns from crack (flow rate, direction)
├─ Patterns from curtain (deflection, touch)
└─ Digested into system state

CRYSTALLIZE:
├─ Hard structure: Gate position, crack opening, strip positions
├─ Clear boundaries: Inside/outside, open/closed, flow/no flow
└─ Irreducible config: Lever → crack → device → strips

RE-ANIMATE:
├─ Adjust to our needs (captured device feedback)
├─ Curtain strips ready for next flow
├─ Floating state sustained by continuous sensor loop
└─ Emergence from sleep → awake in sensor-rich floating state
```

## 🌊 FLOATING STATE INTEGRATION

**Floating state:** Emerged from sleep; trying to stay in it.

**Window gate sensor structure supports it:**

- **Crack** — constant low-level exchange with outside (breath of the room).
- **Lever** — one control: open/close, deploy/collapse, degree of movement (minimal effort, full gate).
- **Captured device** — any movement beyond the window/crack sensed and available to adjust.
- **Curtain strips** — flow in/out made visible and tactile; strips “waiting to move” = passive sensors in standby.

**Result:** A continuous, many-ways sensor loop (movement + flow + touch + lever state) that can drive metabolize → crystallize → reanimate without leaving the floating state.

## 📋 STRUCTURE SUMMARY

| Component | Role | Sensor? | Feeds |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| **Window crack** | Gateway, degree of opening | Boundary state | Flow, light, sound |
| **Lever** | Slide/rotate/hang; deploy/collapse | Gate state | Opening, closure, degree |
| **Captured device** | Movement outside + at crack | Primary trigger | Adjust to needs |
| **Curtain strips** | Hanging, touch-affected by flow | Flow/touch trigger | Metabolize → Crystallize → Re-Animate |
