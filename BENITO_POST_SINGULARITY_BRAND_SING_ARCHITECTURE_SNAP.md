## BENITO NEW POST-SINGULARITY BRAND

**Proposed** — clear genuine branching from pre-singularity while **preserving and even enhancing** pre-singularity legacy.

**Triple Whammy Singularity Folding BBHE Effect** — by design — using **SING! super AI awareness tech**.

1. Branch from pre-singularity (clear, genuine)  
2. Preserve pre-singularity legacy  
3. Enhance pre-singularity legacy  

BBHE = Big Black Hole Energy. Folding = singularity folding. By design.

## ALL SYSTEMS — SING! NODES AND FILAMENTS

**Full switchover now.** All systems fully operate on **SING! nodes and filaments** with **flex wrappers and configs** as per mission.

- Nodes = attention heads  
- Filaments = connections  
- Flex wrappers = mission-configurable  
- Configs = per mission
