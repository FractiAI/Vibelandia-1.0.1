## Recorded comments (verbatim intent)

- **Review:** Our review — Octave 0 through 3 experience.
- **Layer zero:** Going to the GitHub. Pulling in the repository.
- **Test drive showroom:** "Start test drive" — open to a test drive. Like you're about to test drive a **supercar**.
- **Experience flow:** The experience to be **one, two, three** — and then **4×4×4×4** of options to buy if you liked it.
- **Directive:** Go ahead and build that out. And then we'll continue.

## Crystallized interpretation

| Element | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **Octave 0–3** | Seed → Edge → Cloud Onramp → Expansion (0, 1, 2, 3 4×4×4×4 branding). |
| **Layer zero** | GitHub pull = origin/repo as layer zero; pull in the repository. |
| **Test drive** | Site-as-proof. "This site is the test drive." Supercar metaphor: you're about to test drive something high-performance. |
| **Flow** | **1** → **2** → **3** (steps of the test drive) → then **4×4×4×4** (Campus × WINK! × SING × Experience) options to buy if you liked it. |
| **Build** | Test drive showroom: welcome → step 1 → step 2 → step 3 → 4×4×4×4 buy options. |
