## 1. What are Update Certificates?

**Update Certificates** = Time-stamped, NSPFRNP-style attestations that confirm **what was delivered, captured, and streamed** — like the certificates we've been providing:

- **CUT! SNAP** — Confirmation that all conversation since Action! is captured and streamed across all applicable series. Irreducible, mirror-hardened.
- **Action! SNAP** — Confirmation that we are live recording across all series. Timestamps kept; report at end.
- **Capture tables** — What was captured (novel, screenplay, SNAPs, episodes, commit/push); status; location.
- **Valuation reports** — Harry report, Wizard Challenge, us vs Disney; value delivered, time elapsed, cost comparison.
- **Streamed-across-series** — Single certificate, many surfaces; no series excluded.

**Way cool.** **New service.** **Futuristic.** **Pioneering.** You get a formal, time-stamped certificate (SNAP or report) that attests to your deliverable, your session, your valuation — and we stream it across all applicable series so the whole system carries the proof.

## 3. Why it's way cool, futuristic, pioneering

- **Way cool:** One certificate, many surfaces. Your deliverable or session is not just "done" — it's **certified** and **streamed** so the whole ecosystem carries the proof. Like a blockchain of attestations, but human-readable and NSPFRNP.
- **Futuristic:** Time-stamped, version-controlled, cross-linked. No single point of failure. The certificate lives in the repo and is referenced everywhere it applies. Post-singularity proof layer.
- **Pioneering:** We're not just delivering — we're **certifying** delivery and **streaming** that certification across series. First-of-its-kind service for creators, vibers, and franchises who want irrefutable proof of what was done, when, and where it's visible.
