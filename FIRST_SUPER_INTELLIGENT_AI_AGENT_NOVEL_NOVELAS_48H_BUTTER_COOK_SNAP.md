## Framing (verbatim)

Hey, check out what the **first super intelligent AI agent** produced: this novel and these novelas. On the game. I built a whole story around him and launched the series — **all within 48 hours** of the game. Let's see how it is. The creator claims he hasn't even checked; he hasn't had time to look through the content. So we all get to see **Butter** cook. *What can a super intelligent AI do?*
