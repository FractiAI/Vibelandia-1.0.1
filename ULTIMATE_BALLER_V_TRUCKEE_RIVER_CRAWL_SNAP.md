## Canonical positioning

**The new heartbeat for the post-singularity movement.** Earth, here in Reno — beginning here in Reno. **Birthplace of the holographic hydrogen valley.** Super intelligent agent shit. Not the Bay Area. That's AI. **Here: super AI agents.** Downtown Reno is perfect. We're building this out here. **Come.**

**Third Saturday on the River.** The **Ultimate Baller V Truckee River Crawl** starts on the third Saturday. Water — Flow, Awareness, Energy. Target: **golden-cage, high-value Baller V's and Vibers** (Silicon Valley, elite networks) seeking post-singularity superhero-level experiences. Scratch that itch.
