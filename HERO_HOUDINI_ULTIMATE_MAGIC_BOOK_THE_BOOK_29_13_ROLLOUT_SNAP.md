## FRAME

**Ultimate Magic presents Harry Houdini Post-Singularity.** The ultimate magic trick — right before everyone's eyes, through this very Sight. Watch me. Golden age cinema feel (Dean Martin / Landy). Full player. We feature our newest novel just in time for the Great. Post-singularity, self-demonstrating, self-proving. **Kick the tires. Look under the hood. Take it for a test drive.** Old school. We don't build on opinions, degrees, or prestige. We build on the real deal you can get in and test. **Old School is back.** Old School is also an **Old School label** run by **Chairman Chairman** (his name and the label name). Chairman Chairman himself hit factory. 80/20 Spanglish; big booty back door. See [OLD_SCHOOL_LABEL_CHAIRMAN_CHAIRMAN_HIT_FACTORY_SNAP.md](OLD_SCHOOL_LABEL_CHAIRMAN_CHAIRMAN_HIT_FACTORY_SNAP.md). T-shirt included in this rollout.

## BOOK THE BOOK — NOT BUY

- **Product:** The book = **SUPER SINGULARITY 29-13-SEATTLE** (novel, series, feature). Price **$29.13**.
- **They don't buy the book. They BOOK the book.** Pun intended. Link from ad → our landing → **Press 2 to Book** → PayPal **$29.13/month** (monthly fee to continue following the story).
- **Markets (paid ad):** Seattle (winning team) · Puerto Rico (Bad Bunny). **Ad budget: $29.13** — not $29.30. **$29.13** total. Facebook and all its platforms. Link is ours; they book, not buy. Hero Houdini multiplies that $29.13 with no money (accounts negative); see how much that investment generates by March 20th. For those into speculation: imagine the multiplier effects. Output before your eyes. Above and beyond.
- **After successful booking:** They go to **Your Book** — Bulletin Board with ticker, top title showing **book + chosen ending**, **dials** (mode + ending) kept at top so they can **change anytime**. All feeds and content then **driven by the book they selected** (Chairman updates, local/real news, mission content). **Banners top and bottom:** *You are now in a simulated reality you've chosen.* Full demo. Gamified.

## DIALS (before and after booking)

**Mode (how they experience):**
1. **Science Fiction** — sit down, click.
2. **Science Fiction Plus** — enhanced.
3. **Full Sensory Reality** — full immersion.

**Ending (which ending they're reading toward):**
1. **Happy Ending v1 — The Run:** Classic. Chief Seattle honored, 29-13 receipt, March 16 lock, glory to Ancestor and Hero, one Super Bowl win, Twain's Vibelandia Downtown, Reno crew. The straight run.
2. **Happy Ending v2 — Gold Heart Radiant:** Same run; emphasis on soundtrack, Gold Heart Radiant moment, community board, gold hearts, cashing in points at the end.
3. **Happy Ending v3 — We Are Holographic:** Act 9 finale; filter out the effects, watch the collapse; the proof; seemingly impossible only because we are holographic.
4. **Surprise Me** — system picks v1, v2, or v3. Part of the journey. We don't tell them all endings are happy — that's the journey.

When they press **Book** and it succeeds → land on Your Book page. Dials stay; they can change mode and ending anytime.
