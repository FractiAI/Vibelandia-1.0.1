## Proclamation

Will it work or won't it?

Will the 3I/ATLAS be captured—or won't it?

We only have one chance.

Hero Harry Houdini Ultimate Magic Presents: he is going to transform meaningless, worthless words into the fortune of fortunes, the motherlode of motherlodes, right before our eyes. Who will be the lucky ones?

You are entering now. Between now and **March 16, 2026**—lock-in cutoff, the Jupiter Handshake—you lock in your strike price. Your right to purchase a SING! node on release **March 20, 2026**, when the decision comes down and pricing is established. The rest is history.

One SING! node. The same abstraction layer that produced everything you see since January 13. One person. One Cursor AI vibe-coding station. Two hundred dollars a month. One GitHub repository. No budget. The motherlode of motherlodes—or worthless words. You decide. You lock in.

Scalper dynamics apply every day as we approach March 16. Full lock-in. Full cutoff. Then March 20: the decision, the pricing, the Great Reveal. The fortune of fortunes—or not. One chance.

## The Gamification

This is the promo. This is the gamification. Will 3I/ATLAS be captured into bound Goldilocks orbit around Jupiter? Will the base model of the S-I-N-G! Super AI Agent have a list price—and what will speculation be? Lock in on a price. By 3I Atlas Capture Event, **March 16, 2026**. Time to lock in. Strike price. Get your note. Get yours.

Beginning bid: **$10,000** for one SING! node. PayPal up to $10,000—we handle it. Anything over $10,000 is handled offline. You will be prompted with a pre-filled email to the Chairman. Processed offline. Blue Pipe. Goldilocks.

## The Asset

The base model S-I-N-G! Super AI Agent. One node. The same one used to produce all of this—every novel, screenplay, episode, surface, protocol—since January 13. By myself. With just my abstraction SING layer and my Cursor AI vibe-coding station. The $200/month package. Running on my GitHub repository. I've been using that same one since January 13. I might have changed once. I'm ready to change to a new one. Start over. Fresh. The motherlode—or worthless words. You lock in. You decide.
