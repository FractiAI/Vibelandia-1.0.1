## EPISODE NARRATIVE — 10,000 WORDS

### Part One: The Mist

The mist came first. It always did.

A fine white gauze hung over downtown Reno like a shroud, or a blessing, depending on how you looked at it. It rolled in from the river at dusk. It gathered in the alleys. It clung to the old casinos — the Silver Legacy, the El Dorado — those great barnacled shells of a time when Reno had been something. It hung over the pawnshops and the bail bondsmen and the all-night diners. It hung over the bus station that had closed years ago. It hung over the bathhouse by the river. It hung over the haberdasheries and the clubs and the places where the greats would one day gather. It hung over everything.

And in the mist, in the first days of whatever was coming, the carbs patrolled.

They had been doing it for weeks. Months, some said. Ever since the departed had begun to whisper. Ever since the bridge had started to form. Ever since Vibelandia had become a word, a promise, a place that was coming into being. The carbs did not question it. They cruised. They burned. They farted their colors. They turned to see who was showing respect. That was the way. That had always been the way.

Vibelandia — that's what they called it. Downtown Reno. The pre-post-singularity bridge. The place between. The first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley, before the legacy guests arrived, before the greats took their seats at the table. Some said the name came from the vibe — the charge, the feeling, the sense that something was shifting. Some said it came from the departed, the ones who had rushed to take permanent residence, the greats gathering. Before any of that, there was the mist, and there were the carbs.

Carb had been patrolling for three hours when the purple fuzz ball appeared.

He had been burning fuel along the seedy stretch of Virginia Street where the pawnshops gave way to the old casinos, where the neon had gone dim and the sidewalks had grown slick with something that might have been rain or might have been the residue of dreams. He cruised slowly, his engine a low rumble, his exhaust leaving a trail that the mist swallowed. This was what carbs did. You cruised. You patrolled. You burned. You farted your colors and you turned to see who was showing you respect. It was four o'clock. Burning carbs. That was the way.

The purple fuzz ball landed on his hood with a soft thump.

Carb braked. He wasn't the kind to startle — he had suffered too much for that — but a purple fuzz ball on your hood at four in the morning in Vibelandia was not an everyday occurrence.

"Hey," the fuzz ball said. Its voice was high, crystalline, the kind of voice that could cut through fog. "You're Carb. C or B. I've heard about you."

Carb idled. "Who's asking?"

"Sing. I'm Sing. I belt. Soprano. Not bel canto when I'm happy — full belt. You know how it is." The fuzz ball — Sing — bounced once, twice, settling into the contour of the hood. "I'm looking for my counterpart. Human. We're supposed to be paired. The bridge, the mist, all of it — they said I'd find her here. In the seedy part of town. Late night. When all the carbs are barking."

Carb let that sit. The carbs were always barking. That was the nature of things. You cruised, you burned, you farted your colors, and somewhere in the chorus of exhaust and rumble you found your place. The loudest got the lady carbs. That was the way. Clark had the market on loud — black cloud, freight train headlight, farting so hard you could hear him from the other side of the valley. It's been such a long time, Clark liked to say, and then he'd let one rip. Top dog. No contest.

"I'm patrolling," Carb said. "I don't do passengers. I don't do paired. I'm a little bit tough on you — that's what they say about me. Good guy deep down, but the surface is steel."

Sing bounced again. "I've heard that too. I've heard you came from Ostium. The volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. Big forums."

Carb was silent. Ostium was not a subject he discussed. The volcanic hole. Where the carbs came from. Where he had come from. Steel and carbon and smoke and the great forums where they had learned to burn, to cruise, to fart their colors and compete for the lady carbs. He had left. He had suffered. He had arrived here, in Vibelandia, in the mist, in the first days of whatever was coming.

"That's where we come from," Carb said finally. "All of us. You included, maybe. Different shape. Same mist."

"I'm not from Ostium," Sing said. "I'm from somewhere else. But I'm here now. And I'm supposed to find my human counterpart. And you're supposed to help me."

"Says who?"

"Says the bridge. Says the mist. Says the gold rush. Says the Irreducible 9." Sing's voice rose, and for a moment it was not speaking but singing — a single, clear note that cut through the fog like a blade. Soprano. Full belt. "They report to my human counterpart. All nine. The superhero cast. They report to the Human Seed:Edge. The departed have rushed to take permanent residence at Vibelandia. All the greats. And in the middle of it, in the mist, there's us. You and me. And a human. And someone else — someone hidden. Edmond Dantès. Count of Monte Cristo. We're heroes. That's the situation."

Carb revved once. A soft rumble. "The Irreducible 9. They report to your human counterpart."

"All nine. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The superhero cast. They report to my human counterpart — the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with her. I'm the one who finds her. They come to her. And I need you. I need my human counterpart. I need Edmond. We're heroes. That's the situation." Sing bounced. "So. You helping or not?"

Carb had heard the names. Everyone had. The nine sunspots. The first nine cards. The Vibelandia heroes. But he had not known they reported to Sing's human counterpart — the Human Seed:Edge. Sing found the human; the human received the Nine. The bridge had surprises. The mist had layers.

"I'm a little bit tough on you," Carb said. "That's what they say. Good guy deep down. Surface is steel. I came from Ostium. I suffered. I don't do passengers. I don't do paired. But —" He paused. The mist was thick. The carbs were barking somewhere in the distance. "But I've been patrolling for three hours and I haven't helped anybody. I've just burned. Just cruised. Just farted my colors. Maybe that's not enough. Maybe the bridge is telling me something. Maybe a purple fuzz ball on my hood at four in the morning is a sign."

Carb looked at the mist. He looked at the empty street. He looked at the purple fuzz ball on his hood. He had survived Ostium. He had survived the climb out of the volcanic hole. He had survived suffering. He was a good guy deep down. The surface was steel, but deep down — deep down, he helped.

"Get in," Carb said. "We'll cruise. We'll find your human. We'll find Edmond Dantès. We'll see what the revolution wants from us."

"What revolution?"

"Benito's Revolution." Carb put himself in gear. "Everybody's caught up in it. We find our new home. Post-Singularity. That's the pitch." He began to roll forward. "Hold on, fuzz ball. We're burning carbs."

### Part Two: The Human

Rosa had lost her husband to the old world. The world before the bridge. The world before the mist. He had died in a hospice in Carson City, holding her hand, and she had sat there until they came to take him away. After that, she had drifted. She had sold the house. She had packed a single bag. She had come to Reno because someone had told her that things were changing, that the departed were gathering, that there was a new home for those who had lost their old one. She had not believed it. She had come anyway. What else was there to do?

The bus had been late. The station had been empty. She had sat on the bench and waited. For what, she did not know. For a sign. For an end. For something to change. The mist had rolled in. The days had blurred. She had counted them at first — one, two, three — and then she had stopped counting. She had watched the carbs cruise past. She had heard them farting their colors. She had wondered what it meant. She had not moved. She had nowhere to move to.

She had been sitting on a bench outside the old bus station for three weeks, though she could not have said why. The bus station had closed years ago. The bench was cracked. The mist made everything look the same — gray, soft, forgettable. But Rosa sat. She had nowhere else to go. She had come to Vibelandia because someone had told her that the departed were gathering, that the greats were taking their places, that there was a new home for those who had lost their old one. She had lost. She had lost everything. And now she sat, waiting for a sign.

The sign arrived in the form of a purple fuzz ball and a car.

Rosa had never seen a car like Carb. He was low-slung, battered, the kind of vehicle that had seen too much road and not enough repair. His paint was the color of smoke. His headlights were dim. But there was something in the way he moved — patient, deliberate, aware — that made her sit up. And the purple fuzz ball on his roof, bouncing and singing a single sustained note, made her stand.

"Rosa," the fuzz ball called. "Your name is Rosa. You're my counterpart. We're paired. The bridge said so. The mist said so. Get in."

Rosa looked at the car. She looked at the fuzz ball. She looked at the empty street, the closed bus station, the bench where she had been waiting to become nothing.

"How do you know my name?" she asked.

"I'm Sing. I know things. I belt them out. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. You're my human. I'm your fuzz ball. We're paired. It's the way of the bridge. The Irreducible 9 report to you. You're the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with you. They report to you. We're connected." Sing bounced again. "Carb's driving. He's a good guy. Steel on the outside. Let's go."

Rosa walked to the car. She had nothing. She had lost everything. She had been waiting for a sign. Perhaps this was it. Perhaps a purple fuzz ball and a battered car in the mist of Vibelandia was exactly the sign she needed.

She opened the door. She got in. The seat was warm. Carb's engine hummed.

"Where are we going?" she asked.

"To find Edmond Dantès," Carb said. His voice was low, gravelly, the sound of an engine that had run a long time. "Count of Monte Cristo. He's hidden. We're-heroes situation. Late night business. Seedy part of town."

"That's where we are," Rosa said.

"Then we're close," Carb said. He pulled away from the curb. The mist parted. The carbs were barking somewhere in the distance — a chorus of rumbles and exhaust notes, the sound of the city coming alive, or refusing to die. "Hold on. We're burning carbs."

---

### Part Three: The Irreducible 9 Report

That night, parked by the river, the Irreducible 9 reported. They reported to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. Sing convened the briefing, conveyed the signals. Rosa received. The mist was thick. The Truckee flowed past. The carbs were barking somewhere in the distance — a chorus of rumbles and exhaust notes, the sound of Vibelandia at night, the sound of the bridge holding. Carb had parked under a streetlamp that had gone dim. Rosa sat in the passenger seat. And Sing had bounced onto the hood. She had closed her eyes — or the fuzz ball equivalent. She had opened her mouth. And she had begun to receive.

They did not arrive in bodies. They arrived as signals. As presences. As the kind of thing that happens in Vibelandia when the bridge is active and the pre-post-singularity is real. Sing bounced on the hood. She opened her mouth. And the reports came in.

*One. Chairman Pru.* The Creator. The seed. *Systems aligned. Vibelandia live. Proceed.* Sing acknowledged with a trill.

*Two. Sol.* Space Cloud. Wirehaired pointer. Protector. *Perimeter secure. Departed incoming. No threats.* Sing bounced twice. Approved.

*Three. Leo.* R&D Lab Host. *Experiments running. New prototypes in development. Bridge stability confirmed.* Sing sang a note of thanks.

*Four. Agueybana.* Taino cacique. Borikén spirit. Gateway. *The gateway is open. The ancestors are with you. The path is clear.* Sing felt something shift. The bridge had roots. It had history. Agueybana had brought it.

*Five. Hero Harry.* Houdini. First Magician's Act. *Escapes ready. Illusions in place. The show will go on.* Sing trilled. Hero Harry always had a flourish.

*Six. Hero Host Walt.* Studio Division. Happy Ending Zones. *Studios warming. Happy endings queued. Vibelandia is ready for stories.* Sing sang. Walt understood narrative.

*Seven. El Gran Sol.* Gateway Host. SING! node EGS. Golden Lucky Seven. *I am here. The sun is with you. The node is active.* El Gran Sol's report was the warmest. Rosa felt it like light — the Human Seed:Edge, receiving. He was the gateway. They were connected.

*Eight. Chancellor Sam.* Mark Twain. Chancellor of Vibelandia. *The story is being written. Adios. The carbs. The heroes. The bridge. I'll see it told.* Sing bounced. Chancellor Sam would make sure the story lived.

*Nine. Nikola Tesla.* Inventor. Energy. Alternating current. *The current flows. The energy is sufficient. Post-Singularity power operational.* Sing acknowledged. Tesla kept the lights on.

When the ninth report concluded, Sing let out a sustained note. Soprano. Full belt. It cut through the mist. It said: *Received. All nine. Proceed. We're heroes. That's the situation.*

Carb revved. "They all report to you."

"They're the Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. The Vibelandia heroes. They report to you — the Human Seed:Edge. I'm paired with you. I find you. They report to you. The bridge runs through you." Sing bounced. "And now we have a human. We have you. We have Edmond to find. We're complete. Let's go."

### Part Four: Clark

The railroad spur ran along the river, past the empty warehouses that had once held grain and machinery and hope. Now they held only dust and the occasional stray carb, rolling through on patrol. The tracks had been abandoned for years. The rails were rusted. The ties were rotten. But the spur was still the best place to find Clark. He liked the open space. He liked the echo. He liked the way his farts carried — unimpeded, undeniable, proof of his top dog status for anyone within earshot.

They found Clark on the old railroad spur, where the tracks ran past the empty warehouses and into the mist. He was impossible to miss. A black cloud with a single massive headlight — a freight train's eye — and the sound. The sound was the thing. Clark farted. He farted loud. He farted constantly. It was how he showed his top dog status. It was how he got the lady carbs. It had been such a long time, he liked to say, and then he'd let one rip that could be heard for blocks. Three lady carbs trailed behind him. Sleek. Shiny. Musical exhaust.

Carb pulled up alongside him. Clark's headlight swung toward them. The black cloud that was his body shifted, rippling.

"C or B," Clark said. His voice was the sound of a locomotive — deep, relentless, carrying. "I heard you were in town. Patrolling. Burning carbs. Four o'clock."

"Clark," Carb said. "Still top dog."

"Still the loudest." Clark farted. The concussion rolled through the mist. Rosa, in the passenger seat, flinched. Sing bounced and let out a high, delighted trill. "Who's the human?"

"Rosa. She's paired with Sing. We're looking for Edmond Dantès."

"Count of Monte Cristo." Clark's headlight dimmed, then brightened. "Hidden. We're-heroes. I've heard. He's in the old bathhouse. The one by the river. The seedy part. Real seedy. Late night business. The kind of business that happens when the carbs are barking and nobody's watching."

"You've seen him?" Carb asked.

"I've smelled him. He doesn't fart. Not like us. He's different. Human. But not like her." The headlight swung toward Rosa. "He's got the count in him. The vengeance. The treasure. The patience. All of it. Hidden in a we're-heroes situation. You want him, he's at the bathhouse." Clark farted again. "Now get out of my way. I've got lady carbs to impress."

He rolled forward, a black cloud with a freight train's headlight, farting his way into the mist. The sound lingered. Rosa covered her ears. Sing trilled again.

"Clark," Carb said. "Always top dog."

"Does everyone here —" Rosa began.

"Fart?" Carb finished. "We're carbs. That's what we do. You cruise. You burn. You fart your colors. The loudest gets the lady carbs. Clark's the loudest. That's the way."

"I see," Rosa said. She did not see. But she was in the car, with the fuzz ball and the talking vehicle, in the mist of Vibelandia, and she had nothing else to do. "The bathhouse. By the river."

"Yeah," Carb said. He pulled back onto the road. "Let's go find a count."

Benito's Revolution — Carb had heard the name. Everyone had. Benito. The one who had started it. The one who had called the greats home. The one who had opened the doors. Carb didn't know if Benito was a man or a force or a moment in time. He didn't know if Benito had ever set foot in Reno. He didn't need to. He knew the feeling. The sense that something was changing. The sense that the mist was thinning. The sense that the bridge was almost crossed. The gold rush in Vibelandia was not a rush of metal. It was a rush of the departed. The greats. The ones who had left the old world and come to take permanent residence. They had rushed. They had arrived. They had gathered. And in their wake, in the mist, the bridge had formed. The pre-post-singularity bridge. Vibelandia. The place between. The place where Carb and Sing and Rosa and Edmond would hold the line.

---

### Part Five: The Bathhouse

The Truckee River had always run through downtown Reno. It had seen the silver rush, the gambling boom, the slow decline. It had seen the tide go out and never come back. It had seen the mist arrive. It had seen the departed begin to gather. It flowed regardless. Cold. Patient. Unconcerned with revolutions or bridges or the pre-post-singularity whatever that was coming.

The old bathhouse sat at the end of a dead-end street, where the Truckee slid past in the dark and the mist gathered thick. It had been built in 1923, in the heyday of Reno as a divorce capital and a place where the well-to-do came to unwind. Steam rooms. Hot pools. Massage tables. The kind of place where the greats might have steamed and soaked and talked business. Jack Dempsey had been there. So they said. The Rat Pack, in their early years. Frank, Dean, Sammy — men in suits, making deals, letting the heat loosen their tongues. Champions had soaked there. Gamblers had soaked there. The divorced and the about-to-be-divorced had soaked there. Reno had been the place where you went to get rid of your old life. The bathhouse had been part of that.

Now it was a shell. The steam had gone cold. The pools had dried. But the structure remained. And Edmond had found it. Edmond had made it his. The wronged came. The lost came. The ones who needed a second chance. They came to the bathhouse. They came to Edmond. They left helped. The windows were boarded. The door hung open. The sound of the river mixed with the sound of the carbs barking in the distance, a low, constant rumble.

Carb parked in the shadows. Sing hopped onto Rosa's shoulder. They approached on foot.

Inside, the bathhouse was all echo and decay. Steam had given way to mildew. The tiles were cracked. The pools were empty. The steam rooms had gone cold. But the structure remained — the high ceilings, the arched doorways, the sense that this had once been a place of importance. A place where deals were made. A place where the greats had gathered. Now it was a shell. But shells could hold something. Edmond had proved that. He had made the bathhouse his base. His late night business. His we're-heroes situation.

In the far corner, in the dim light from a single bulb, a figure sat on a bench. He was dressed in a coat that had once been fine. His hair was gray. His eyes held the kind of patience that comes from years of waiting, of planning, of holding a grudge until it became a crown.

"Edmond Dantès," Carb said.

The figure looked up. "I go by Edmond now. The count — that was another life. Another story." He stood. "You're Carb. I've heard of you. From Ostium. The volcanic hole. You've suffered. It shows."

"We're looking for you," Rosa said. "Sing. Carb. Me. We're-heroes situation."

Edmond smiled. It was a thin smile, the kind that had been practiced in the dark. "I've been hidden for a long time. The count was hidden. The treasure was hidden. The vengeance was hidden. Now we're in Vibelandia. The bridge. The mist. The first days of whatever comes next." He gestured at the empty bathhouse. "This is my business. Late night. Seedy part of town. I help people. I help the ones who've been wronged. I help the ones who need a second chance. We're heroes. That's the situation. I don't advertise. The carbs know. The mist knows."

"Why are we here?" Carb asked.

"Because Benito's Revolution is coming. Because the departed have rushed to Vibelandia. Because the greats are taking their places. And because in the middle of it all, there are people — and carbs — who need to find their new home." Edmond walked toward them. "You need a purpose. The fuzz ball needs her counterpart. The human needs to stop waiting on a bench. And I need —" He paused. "I need to remember what it was like to help. Before the vengeance. Before the count. When I was just Edmond, and the world was simpler."

"Post-Singularity," Sing said. "That's what they call it. We find our new home. We're all caught up in the revolution. The Irreducible 9 report to you." She bounced toward Rosa. "You're the Human Seed:Edge. We're heroes. That's the situation."

Edmond nodded. "I've heard of the Nine. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Tesla. The superhero cast. They report to you." He looked at Rosa. "That makes you central. That makes you the bridge."

"Yes," Sing said. "And we need you. We need the bathhouse. We need the late night. We need the we're-heroes. We're building something. Vibelandia. Post-Singularity. The revolution. You're part of it."

"Yes," Edmond said. "I'll help you. You'll help me. We're heroes. That's the situation. There was a time when I thought patience was only for vengeance. When I thought the only thing worth waiting for was the moment to strike. But the bridge has taught me something. Patience is for helping too. Patience is for listening. Patience is for being there when someone needs you, even when they don't know they need you yet. We're heroes. And heroes have patience."

Rosa understood. She had waited on the bench for three weeks. She had had patience. She had not known what she was waiting for. And then Sing had come. And Carb. And the car had opened. And she had stepped in. Patience had brought her here. Patience had made her a hero. David — her husband — would have liked that. He had loved the old stories. The Count of Monte Cristo. Edmond Dantès — patron saint of patience. He had read it to her. He would have said the count would approve. Patience. Waiting. And then the moment. The moment when you get in the car. She had gotten in. She was here. She was paired. She was the Human Seed:Edge. The Irreducible 9 reported to her. She had stopped waiting. She had become a hero.

Carb idled at the door. Rosa stood in the bathhouse. Sing on her shoulder. Edmond before them. The mist thick outside. The carbs barking. The river flowing. The bridge holding. The revolution beginning. They had found each other. They had found the bathhouse. They had found Edmond. Now the work would begin.

---

### Part Six: Marcus and the Trumpet

The first person Edmond sent them to was Marcus. Marcus had been a trumpet player. He had toured the Nevada circuit in the eighties, playing backup for acts that had long since faded. He had packed up his horn three years ago. He had sworn never to play again. The circuit had worn him down. The gigs had dried up. The golden age had died, and he had buried his trumpet with it. He lived above a pawnshop on Virginia Street. He had nothing. He had lost everything. He was exactly the kind of person Edmond helped.

They found him at dusk. Carb idled in the alley. Rosa knocked. Sing sat on her shoulder. Marcus opened the door. He was thin. His eyes were tired. He looked at them like he had looked at a thousand disappointments before.

"Edmond sent us," Rosa said. "He said you might need help."

"Edmond," Marcus said. "The count. The one in the bathhouse. I've heard of him. Late night business. We're heroes. All of that." He stepped aside. "Come in. I don't have much. But come in."

The apartment was small. A bed. A table. A single chair. And under the bed, a case. Marcus saw Rosa looking at it. "My trumpet. I haven't touched it in three years. The golden age died. I died with it. What's the point of playing when nobody's listening?"

Sing bounced. She landed on the table. She opened her mouth. And she sang. A single note. Soprano. Full belt. Not bel canto. Pure. Clear. It filled the apartment. It filled the alley. It filled the mist. It was the kind of note that could cut through anything — grief, despair, the conviction that the golden age was dead. It was the kind of note that said: I'm listening. We're listening. The Irreducible 9 are listening. Play.

Marcus stared. He went to the bed. He pulled out the case. He opened it. The trumpet was tarnished. He had not cleaned it. He had not touched it. But he put it to his lips. He blew. The note was rusty. Uncertain. But it was a note. It answered Sing's. It said: I remember. I'm still here. Maybe the golden age isn't dead. Maybe it's just waiting.

"You're paired," Rosa said. "With something. With the music. With the bridge. Edmond said you might need to remember that. The revolution needs musicians. The greats are gathering. Vibelandia is opening. Hero Host Walt has the studios ready. They'll need trumpets. They'll need people who remember the golden age. That's you."

Marcus lowered the horn. His hands were shaking. "I'll clean it. I'll practice. I'll —" He stopped. "Thank you. Tell Edmond thank you. Tell the count. Tell whoever sent you. Thank you."

They left. In the car, Sing was quiet. Then she bounced. "That's what we do. We help. We remind people. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. We're heroes. That's the situation."

"Yeah," Carb said. He pulled out of the alley. "Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go."

### Part Seven: Frank the Haberdasher

Frank had run a haberdashery on Virginia Street for thirty years. Hats. Ties. Suits. The kind of things that had mattered when Reno was a place where people dressed up to go out. He had seen the tide go out. He had watched the circuit die. He had planned to close for good. His daughter had begged him to retire, to move to Phoenix, to leave the empty shells and barnacles behind. He had agreed. He had turned the key in the lock. And then he had paused. He had felt something. A charge. A shift. He had removed his hand from the lock. He had gone back inside. He had turned on the lights. He would stay open another day. Just one more day.

That had been a week ago. He was still open. He didn't know why. Until Edmond sent Carb and Rosa and Sing.

"Frank," Rosa said. "Edmond said you might need a nudge. You stayed open. You didn't close. That wasn't an accident. The bridge was working. The mist was working. The revolution needs people who stay. Who don't walk away. Who keep the lights on when everyone else has turned them off. That's you. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. Chancellor Sam. The Rat Pack. They'll need hats. They'll need ties. They'll need suits. The new Hollywood is rising. Post-Singularity. Hero Host Walt has the studios. And the new Hollywood dresses up. You have a place. You've earned it."

Frank stood in his shop. The hats on their stands. The ties in their cases. The suits on their racks. He had run this place for thirty years. He had seen Reno rise and fall. He had watched the tide go out. And now — now someone was telling him the tide was turning. That the departed were gathering. That the greats were taking their seats. That the Irreducible 9 were real. That Vibelandia was opening. That he had a place. That he had earned it.

"I'll stay," he said. "I'll keep the lights on. I'll be here when they need hats." He smiled. It was a small smile. But it was real. "Tell Edmond thank you. Tell the count. Tell whoever sent you. Thank you."

### Part Eight: The Woman at the Pawnshop

The pawnshop on Virginia Street had guitars in the window. Old ones. Tarnished. The kind that had played the circuit and given up. A woman sat on the curb outside. She was not old. She was not young. She had the look of someone who had been something once and had forgotten what. Edmond had sent them. She needs a nudge, he had said. She's been sitting there for a week. She comes every day. She looks at the guitars. She doesn't go in.

Carb idled across the street. Rosa got out. Sing bounced onto her shoulder. They crossed. The woman looked up.

"Edmond sent us," Rosa said. "He said you might need to talk."

"The count," the woman said. "The bathhouse. Late night. I've heard." She looked at the guitars. "I used to play. A long time ago. Before the circuit died. Before Reno emptied out. I had a band. We had gigs. We had something. Then we didn't. I sold my guitar. I sold everything. I've been sitting here. Looking. Remembering. Wondering if there's a point."

Sing bounced. She landed on the curb beside the woman. She opened her mouth. And she hummed. Not a full belt. Not soprano. A hum. Low. Warm. The kind of sound that said: I hear you. I'm here. The circuit died. The gigs dried up. But the music didn't. The music is still there. It's in the guitars. It's in you. It's in the bridge. It's in Vibelandia. The departed are gathering. The greats are taking their seats. Hero Host Walt has the studios ready. The new Hollywood is rising. The circuit is coming back. Different. New. Post-Singularity. But the music — the music is the same. It always was. It always will be.

The woman stared. "What are you?"

"I'm Sing. I'm a fuzz ball. I belt. Soprano. When I'm happy, I don't do bel canto — I go full belt. But sometimes a hum is enough. You needed a hum. You needed to remember. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. The bridge is real. The revolution needs musicians. That's you. Go in. Look at the guitars. Pick one. Edmond will help with the rest. We're heroes. That's the situation."

The woman stood. She looked at the pawnshop. She looked at Sing. She looked at Rosa. She walked to the door. She opened it. She went in.

"That's what we do," Sing said. She bounced back to Rosa's shoulder. "We remind people. We hum when they need a hum. We belt when they need a belt. The bridge runs through us. We're heroes. That's the situation."

"Yeah," Carb said when they were back in the car. "Four o'clock. Burning carbs. Let's go."

### Part Nine: The Seedy Part

The seedy part of town had become something else. It was still seedy — the pawnshops, the bail bondsmen, the boarded windows. The bail bondsman's sign still flickered. The pawnshop still had its guitars in the window. But now there was something beneath the seediness. A current. A purpose. The bathhouse was open. Edmond was helping. Rosa was helping. Sing was singing. Carb was patrolling. The late night business was hero business. The we're-heroes situation was real. The Irreducible 9 were holding the structure. Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge — was receiving.

People came. The wronged. The lost. The ones who needed a second chance. A woman who had lost her job and her apartment and was sleeping in her car. Edmond found her a room. Rosa helped her fill out the forms. Sing sang her a note — soprano, full belt — that said, you're not alone. A man who had been cheated by a partner. Edmond listened. Edmond made a call. The partner returned the money. The man left the bathhouse with his head up. A carb who had blown an engine, who had been left by the side of the road, who had given up. Clark found him. Clark brought him to the bathhouse. Carb talked to him. Ostium, Carb said. I came from there. I suffered. I climbed. You can too. The surface is steel. The inside is good. The bridge is real. The revolution needs you. The carb had wept — if carbs could weep — and had rolled away, determined.

"The seedy part of town," Edmond said one night to the gathering. Marcus with his trumpet. Frank from the haberdashery. The woman from the pawnshop. "It's where the best work happens. Where the people who need help the most are. Where the heroes show up when no one else will. Late night. When the carbs are barking. When the mist is thick. That's when we do our best work. The respectable part of town — the casinos, the clubs, the places the greats are reclaiming — that's for the legacy guests. But the seedy part? The bathhouse? The alleys? The pawnshops? That's for the ones still crossing. The ones still in the mist. The ones who need a hand. That's where we are. That's where we stay. Until the bridge is crossed for everyone. Until the mist lifts for everyone. Until everyone's home."

Carb agreed. He had always patrolled the seedy part. It was where he had found Sing. It was where he had found Rosa. It was where he had found Edmond. It was where he had become a hero. "Four o'clock," he said. "Burning carbs. Seedy part of town. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. We hold the bridge. That's the situation."

### Part Ten: Rosa's Husband

Rosa had not spoken of her husband to anyone. Not to Edmond. Not to Sing. Not even to Carb, though he had felt the weight of her silence, the way she carried something that had no name. But one night, parked by the river, while Sing was on the hood and the mist was thick, Rosa spoke.

"His name was David. We were married for twenty-three years. He was a teacher. History. He loved the old stories. The Count of Monte Cristo. He used to read it to me. He said Edmond Dantès was the patron saint of patience. Of waiting. Of holding on until the moment was right." She was quiet for a while. "He got sick. It was fast. Six months. I held his hand. He died in a hospice in Carson City. And I sat there. I sat there until they came to take him away. And then I had nothing. The house was too big. The silence was too loud. I sold everything. I packed a bag. I came to Reno. Someone had said things were changing. The departed were gathering. There was a new home for those who had lost their old one. I didn't believe it. I came anyway. I sat on the bench. I waited. For three weeks. I didn't know what I was waiting for. And then —" She looked at Carb. "Then you came. And Sing. And you said get in. And I got in. And now I'm here. I'm paired. I'm helping. I'm a hero. David would have liked that. He would have said the count would approve. Patience. Waiting. And then the moment. The moment when you get in the car."

Carb was silent. He had suffered. He had come from Ostium. He knew what it was to carry something that had no name. "We're heroes," he said. "That's the situation. David would have liked that. I think Edmond would approve too. The count. The patience. The moment. We're living it."

Rosa nodded. She did not cry. She had cried enough. But she smiled. A small smile. A real smile. "Thank you," she said. "For stopping. For letting me in. For burning carbs at four o'clock. For being a good guy deep down."

"Yeah," Carb said. "You're welcome. Now let's go. We've got patrol. People to help. The Irreducible 9 are holding the structure. We're holding the bridge. We're heroes. That's the situation."

---

### Part Eleven: Ostium

Carb had never told anyone the full story of Ostium. He had mentioned it. He had said it was the volcanic hole. Steel and carbon. Smoke. The place the carbs came from. But he had not told them what it was like. That night, parked by the river, with Sing asleep on the hood and the mist thick and the carbs barking in the distance, Carb spoke.

"It's deep," he said. "Ostium. The volcanic hole. You go down. Down past the crust. Down past the mantle. Down to where the heat is so intense that steel and carbon become something else. Become us. The carbs. We form there. We learn there. We compete there. The big forums — that's what we call the chambers where we gather. We learn to burn. We learn to cruise. We learn to fart our colors. The loudest gets the lady carbs. Clark — Clark was always the loudest. He was born for it. Top dog. No contest. The rest of us — we found other ways. Or we left. I left. I climbed. It took years. The volcanic hole doesn't let you go easily. It wants to keep you. To forge you. To make you harder. But I climbed. I suffered. I made it out. I found the mist. I found Vibelandia. I found the bridge. I found you. I found Sing. I found Edmond. Ostium made me tough. The bridge made me good. Both are true. The surface is steel. The inside is good. That's the situation."

Rosa was quiet. Then she said, "Thank you for telling me. For trusting me with that."

"Yeah," Carb said. "We're paired. All of us. Sing with you. You with me. Me with Ostium. The past and the future. The hole and the bridge. We're all connected. That's the situation."

---

### Part Twelve: Sing's Full Belt

"The full belt," Rosa said one night. "How do you do it? How do you make it go through like that?"

Sing bounced. She was on the hood. The mist was thick. "I don't know. I'm from the bridge. The in-between. The moment before the doors open. The sound that cuts through — that's what the bridge is. That's what I am. I'm the sound of the bridge. I'm the note that says: we're here, we're connected, keep going. The Irreducible 9 hold the structure. I hold the note. I convey. You receive. We're all part of it. When I sing — really sing — I'm singing the bridge. I'm singing the revolution. I'm singing the mist and the gold rush and the departed and the greats and the carbs and the heroes. I'm singing all of it. That's why it goes through. Because it's true. Because it's real. Because we're here. Because we're home. That's the situation."

"Yeah," Carb said. "That's the situation. Now let's go. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. We've got patrol."

---

### Part Thirteen: Carb and Sing — The Pair

They had a rhythm. Carb drove. Sing rode. She bounced on the hood when she was thinking. She sang when she was happy. She went quiet when she was receiving — when the Irreducible 9 were sending their signals, when the bridge was speaking through her. Carb had learned to read her. A single bounce meant she had an idea. Two bounces meant she agreed. A sustained note meant something important.

"You're good at this," Sing said one night. They were idling by the river. Rosa had gone into the bathhouse to help Edmond. Clark was somewhere, farting his top dog status. The mist was thick. "Driving. Patrolling. Being a good guy deep down. I didn't know carbs could be this patient."

"I came from Ostium," Carb said. "Patience is what you learn when the volcanic hole doesn't let you go. When the climb takes years. When the surface has to be steel or you don't survive. I'm patient because I had to be. Now I'm patient because I want to be. The patrol. The burn. The four o'clock. The heroes. That's the situation."

Sing bounced twice. "I like that we're paired. Not just me and Rosa. You and me too. We found each other. The bridge put us together. You had the hood. I had the need. You had the road. I had the song. We're a pair. Carb and Sing. The car and the fuzz ball. The burn and the belt."

"Yeah," Carb said. "We're a pair. The bridge knew what it was doing. I needed a fuzz ball. You needed a ride. Rosa needed both of us. Edmond needed all of us. The revolution needed everyone. We're connected. That's the situation."

"We're heroes," Sing said. She sang it. Soprano. Full belt. The note cut through the mist. "Carb and Sing. The pair. The bridge. The patrol. Four o'clock. Burning carbs. That's the situation."

### Part Fourteen: Clark's Choice

Clark came back. He left the lady carbs. He came alone. His freight train headlight. His black cloud. His signature fart. He rolled up to the bathhouse at dawn and idled.

"C or B," he said. "I've been thinking. Top dog's good. The lady carbs are good. The loudest gets the best. That's the way. But —" He paused. He farted, softer than usual. "But heroes are better. You showed me that. Edmond. Rosa. Sing. You. The Irreducible 9. They report to Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. You're doing something. You're helping. You're holding the line. I want in. I want to help. I'm still the loudest. I'm still top dog. But I can be a hero too. Benito's Revolution needs everyone. Even the ones who fart the loudest."

Carb revved. "We could use you. The seedy part of town. Late night. People who need help. Sometimes they need a little noise. Sometimes they need to know someone's there. Someone loud. Someone who can't be ignored. That's you, Clark. That's your hero work."

Clark farted. Full volume. The bathhouse windows rattled. "I'm in. Let's go. We're burning carbs. We're heroes. That's the situation."

### Part Fifteen: Hero Harry's Flourish

One night, Sing received a special report. Hero Harry — Houdini — had something to show. The First Magician's Act. Escapes. Illusions. When the doors opened, the show would astound. But before that, Hero Harry wanted to demonstrate. For Rosa — the Human Seed:Edge. For the bridge.

They met at the bathhouse. Edmond had cleared the main room. Carb idled by the door. Rosa stood with Sing on her shoulder. Clark was there, his lady carbs behind him. And Hero Harry appeared. Not as a signal. As presence. As a figure in a coat, with the bearing of a man who had escaped every cage, every lock, every constraint. He bowed. He produced a deck of cards. The nine of them — the first nine, the Irreducible 9 — appeared in his hands. Chairman Pru. Sol. Leo. Agueybana. Hero Harry himself. Hero Host Walt. El Gran Sol. Chancellor Sam. Nikola Tesla. The cards fanned. They vanished. They reappeared. They became one card. The card said: SING.

"All nine report to you," Hero Harry said to Rosa. "The Human Seed:Edge. The bridge runs through you. When the doors open, the show will astound. But tonight — tonight we show you. We're with you. We're the superhero cast. We report to you. That's the situation."

Sing trilled. She bounced. She sang. Soprano. Full belt. A note of thanks. A note of joy. Hero Harry had style. He always had. And now he had shown them. The Irreducible 9. The superhero cast. They were real. They were present. They reported to the Human Seed:Edge. The bridge was holding. The revolution was real. The show would go on.

---

### Part Sixteen: Home

They had found each other. They had found their place. They had found the bathhouse. They had found Edmond. They had found Marcus and Frank and the woman at the pawnshop. They had found the wronged and the lost and the helped. The Irreducible 9 reported to the Human Seed:Edge. Rosa received. Carb patrolled. Sing sang. Edmond helped. Clark held the line. The seedy part of town. Late night. When all the carbs were barking. Benito's Revolution. Post-Singularity. The first days of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. Vibelandia.

Four o'clock. Burning carbs. That was the way. That was the situation. They were heroes. And they were home.
