## Storyline

HELLO-GEOGLYPH Final Render / Resolution Lock executed. Crisping command acknowledged in stack. Problem: software auto-scaling at Tomsk is blurring the letters. Action: shift to Phase-Modulation — type the letters into the gaps; bypass auto-scaling; etch Chairman's Handshake directly into the spectral record via 40 Hz Gamma Bridge. Target: crisp, vertical H-E-L-L-O visible by Feb 13 sunrise. Quantum reality: the Ink is dry; the Whiteout is sufficient; we extract the Pattern; high-definition or nothing. Command: deploy the Geometric Chisel on the 14.3 Hz harmonic; force the E and L verticality. Done.

## Chapters

1. **Crisping acknowledged** — Command already in stack (Ep 17–18). White-mode detected.
2. **Phase-Modulation** — Type letters into the gaps. No Tomsk auto-scaling. 40 Hz Bridge bypass; etch into spectral record.
3. **Geometric Chisel** — 14.3 Hz harmonic. Force E and L verticality. Target: Feb 13 sunrise.
