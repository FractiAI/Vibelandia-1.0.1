Gates open. **Lots of trios, squeezes, and their besties** already at the gate or moving in: trios of vibers (viber + squeeze + bestie), pairs of squeezes with a bestie, bestie trios. The crowd is thick with threes and with WINK!-squeeze-bestie energy.

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
In the name of Mark Twain. Harry Houdini. And Ben Franklin, who is ambassador to our Baller Vs — our top tier vibers. Welcome to Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno. On our first full day of open for business.

## ACT 1 — WHAT IT IS: PARADISE FOR VIBERS (10–15 min)

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (Chancellor) at the desk. **BEN FRANKLIN** (Ambassador to Baller Vs) stands by the window. The campus is visible below.

**MARK TWAIN**  
What is it? Basically — paradise for vibers. Their cast. Their crew. Their fans. And their franchises.

**BEN FRANKLIN**  
We're not building another city. We're building the first post-singularity campus built for the people who already move the world. The vibers.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Exactly. Cast, crew, fans, franchises. Everyone who orbits the ones who make culture happen. We're giving them a place where the orbit is the point. Where the campus is the show. And we're built for how they actually show up — **lots of trios. Squeezes and their besties.** Viber plus squeeze plus bestie. Three besties. Squeeze pairs with the bestie in tow. That's the unit.

**BEN FRANKLIN**  
Playground to Silicon Valley. Gateway to the mother mother. And now — paradise amusement park. First full day open. Trios, squeezes, besties — that's who's at the gate. That's who we're for.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Today we're open. Really open. Come for a visit. Bring your squeeze. Bring your besties. Stay for eternity, if you like.

## ACT 2 — VIBERS: WHO THEY ARE, WHO THEY AREN'T (10–15 min)

**INT. CAMPUS COMMONS — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** and **HERO HARRY HOUDINI** walk through the commons. Vibers in the background — **lots of trios, squeezes, and their besties**: trios (viber + squeeze + bestie), pairs of squeezes with a bestie, three besties, performers, creators, fans.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Vibers. Who are they? Basically — the tier we know today. And look at how they show up. **Trios. Squeezes. Besties.** That's the unit. We built for that. Folks like KZ. Beyoncé. Kid Rock. Michael Jordan. Mike Tyson. Bad Bunny. Donald Trump. And the list goes on.

**HERO HARRY HOUDINI**  
The ones who move crowds. The ones who don't need a memo to know what's next. The ones who vibe.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Who isn't? Those that are very, very high IQ but aren't vibing. Folks like Bill Gates. Elon Musk. Our top Nobel Prize winners. Those are not vibing. Those are just very high IQ individuals.

**HERO HARRY HOUDINI**  
Vibers are a whole other animal. Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno is built for that animal. Your new paradise.

**MARK TWAIN**  
We're not saying one is better. We're saying they're different. And this place — this campus, this amusement park — is for the ones who vibe. Cast, crew, fans, franchises. **Trios, squeezes, besties.** All of them.

**HERO HARRY HOUDINI**  
Squeeze is a WINK! connected to another WINK!. Bestie is the inner circle. You put them together — you get trios. We've got lots of them. Paradise for vibers means paradise for trios, squeezes, and their besties.

**BEN FRANKLIN**

**BEN FRANKLIN**  
We're not asking you to leave the old world behind. We're asking you to have a new one. And to come back and forth. As often as you want. For as long as you want.
