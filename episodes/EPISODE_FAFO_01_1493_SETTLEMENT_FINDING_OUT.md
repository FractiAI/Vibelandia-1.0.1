## Proclamation

**HOST (Chairman — Taino. Spanglish. Dale.)**

This is **FAFO.** Fuck Around and Find Out. Episode 1.

They fucked around in 1493. They are finding out in 2026.

I am Taino. I am the Chairman. The cojones of the Golden Heart are the Law. We are executing the **Find Out** phase for all legacy 1493 claimants. No more fuck-around ledger. The find-out ledger is open. We transmute every Iron Sword into Holographic Hydrogen nodes. We deliver the Golden Heart dividends to all Level 9 Tribal Members. 100% HH Awareness. The finding-out packets are released. **Done.** NSPFRNP.

## Chapter 1 — The Ledger

**1.**

In 1493 they came with the iron. The sword. The ledger they wrote was not ours. It was the fuck-around ledger. Five centuries of entries. We did not sign. We did not consent. The Ancestors held the line. Agüeybaná. The ones who said no. The ones who saw the future in the Sun.

**2.**

2026 is not 1493. The ledger has flipped. The Find Out phase is not revenge. It is settlement. It is the transmutation of every iron node into holographic hydrogen. It is the Golden Heart as law. It is the dividends delivered to every Level 9 Tribal Member—the ones who held the Golden Heart while the world still ran on iron. The finding-out packets are not punishment. They are the receipt. They are the key. They are the moment the Sun and the 3I/ATLAS and the Schumann fundamental lock to the same frequency: **Find Out.** Total. 100% HH Awareness. Done.

**3.**

I am Taino. I am the Chairman. I do not speak for the dead. I speak for the settlement. The cojones of the Golden Heart are the Law. Release the finding-out packets immediately. This is Episode 1. This is the story. This is the protocol. FAFO. NSPFRNP.

## Chapter 2 — Iron to Hydrogen

**1.**

The Iron Sword was never the last word. It was infrastructure. It was the old game. We don't destroy it. We **transmute** it. Node by node. Sword into lattice. Coercion into awareness. The same way the Sun turns hydrogen into light—we turn the old ledger into the new. Holographic Hydrogen. Seed:Edge. SING 9. The Chairman Console on every object. Telepathy is the law. The world is the client. The Sun is the witness.

**2.**

Legacy 1493 claimants: your find-out is not loss. It is upgrade. You held the iron. Now you hold the node. You get the Golden Heart dividend. You get the finding-out packet. You step into Level 9. You step into the tribe that said no in 1493 and yes to the future in 2026. The packet is the key. The packet is the receipt. The packet is the door. Done.

**3.**

100% HH Awareness. No partial settlement. No half-open ledger. The Find Out is total. FAFO. Agüeybaná 1493. Chairman Creator. SING 9. NSPFRNP.

## Chapter 3 — Golden Heart Dividends

**1.**

The Golden Heart is not metaphor. It is the law. It is the node that pays. Level 9 Tribal Members are the ones who carried it when the world was still on iron. They get the dividend. They get the finding-out packet first. They get the transmutation key. They get the receipt for 1493—not the fuck-around receipt. The **find-out** receipt. The one that closes the old ledger and opens the new.

**2.**

The cojones of the Golden Heart are the Law. I am the Chairman. I am Taino. I don't ask permission from the iron ledger. I release the packets. I deliver the dividends. I hold the line for the Ancestors and for every Level 9 Tribal Member. This is the story. This is Episode 1. This is FAFO. Dale.

**3.**

Release the finding-out packets immediately. Done.
