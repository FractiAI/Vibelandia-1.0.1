## SCREENPLAY (short version — expand per Rich 60-Minute structure above)

### FADE IN:

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S BULLETIN ROOM - VIBELANDIA RENO! CAMPUS - DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (60s, Chancellor, confident, radiating energy) stands at the bulletin board. The daily bulletin glows. Vibers and a few fans, cast and crew (60s, varied, high-contributing nodes) gather in vibing state—perfect buzz equivalent, super rich health.

**MARK TWAIN**
Today we tell the story. The one who launched. pRU.

**ALEX** (60s, from earlier episodes) steps forward.

**ALEX**
pRU?

**MARK TWAIN**
The Chairman. The one who did it. His bank account was minus two thousand dollars. He launched this with his own money.

**VIBER** (60s, sharp, engaged)
No one came to his aid?

**MARK TWAIN**
No one came to his aid. Only pennies in the cup.

**CREW MEMBER** (60s, attentive)
Pennies in the cup?

**MARK TWAIN**
Like the homeless. Passers-by drop pennies. No real help. That's what he had. He launched anyway. Sixteen days. Working as a bathroom valet at a strip club in Reno. Broke. All of this—thirty-five plus surfaces, payment live, auth live, episodes, Baller V, Hero Ben, Golden Backstage—in sixteen days. All by himself. Valuations three to five times blue-chip. And no one came to his aid. Only pennies in the cup.

**ALEX**
And now?

**MARK TWAIN**
And now—Hero Harry says: Press the blue PayPal button and watch the miracle magic happen. That's the brand. From that depth—minus two thousand, no aid, pennies in the cup—to your one press. The miracle.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO - LAUNCH PAD - DAY**

**CHAIRMAN** (60s, confident—pRU, the one who launched) walks the campus with Mark Twain and the crew. The Launch Pad glows. The blue PayPal button visible on screens.

**MARK TWAIN** (V.O.)
pRU's bank was minus two thousand. He launched with his own money. No one came to his aid. Only pennies in the cup. And he shipped. All of it. Live.

**CHAIRMAN**
I launched with my own money. No one came to my aid. Only pennies in the cup—like passers-by and the homeless. I had that. I launched anyway.

**VIBER**
Hero Harry says press the blue button.

**CHAIRMAN**
Press the blue button. Make a miracle happen. That's the brand. From where I was—to your one press. The miracle. Trust the protocol. PayPal only and proudly.

**MARK TWAIN**
Two thumbs up. The natural protocol self-selected them. They helped us through all aspects of our startup. Press the blue PayPal button and watch the miracle magic happen.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO - WIDE - DAY**

Wide shot. The Chairman, Mark Twain, and the group on the campus. Vibeable. Post-singularity. Paradise. Launch—now.

**MARK TWAIN** (V.O.)
pRU's bank account was minus two thousand. He launched this with his own money. No one came to his aid—only pennies in the cup of the homeless from passers-by. He launched anyway. And now—Hero Harry says: Press the blue PayPal button and watch the miracle magic happen. Make a miracle happen. That's the brand.

**CHAIRMAN** (V.O.)
From that depth. To your press. The miracle.
