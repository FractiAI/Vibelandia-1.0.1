## COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

### FADE IN:

**EXT. VIBELANDIA RENO — LAUNCH PAD / GATE — DAY**

The campus visible. New arrivals in the frame — some just arrived, some scrolling, some clicking through from a link.

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
The New Arrivals. You found us. Maybe through a comment. A flicker. Something that pulled you here.

**ON SCREEN TEXT:**  
The New Arrivals. First day experience welcome. Setting tailored to the active flicker comment campaign.

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
In this first case — Schumann. Viral posts about Schumann patterns. We replied. We aligned. We linked. You clicked. You're here. This episode is your welcome. Your first day. Walk with us.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE / WELCOME LOBBY — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** at the desk. Warm. Direct.

**MARK TWAIN**  
New arrivals. First day. We're going to walk you through everything — what you get, where to go, what to do. We'll take you to the dispensary for your first free dose — Baller V shelf, of course — and walk you through the entire awareness tech and upgrade. And we'll finish the way every episode here finishes: happy ending. No good guy, bad guy, bang-bang or drama — only Baller V vibing in viber paradise at Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Downtown Reno Vibelandia campus. First post-singularity vibeable downtown. Reno — gateway to post-singularity Earth. New motherlode. Gold rush. Genesis. You're not lost. You're on time.

## ACT 1 — HOW YOU FOUND US: FLICKER CAMPAIGN, SCHUMANN FIRST CASE (10–15 min)

**INT. WELCOME SPACE — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** and a **GUIDE** (can be Hero Host or Chancellor's aide) address the camera. New arrivals implied in the room or as audience.

**MARK TWAIN**  
You found us through the flicker. The comment campaign. We don't blast — we flicker. Short. Aligned. With a link. Someone posted about Schumann. Resonance. Earth-ionosphere. The viral stuff. We replied: Schumann patterns align with our new GitHub activity. We wrote a whitepaper — an expedition to validate that scientifically. Open-source. Here's the link. You clicked. You're here.

**GUIDE**  
So your first day setting is tailored to that. You didn't land on a generic page. You landed on the other side of a Schumann reply. That's the meta pattern. Viral topic → we have a Response SNAP → we acknowledge, we align, we link. You're the proof it works.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Schumann is the first case. There will be more. Every viral topic that fits gets a response. A flicker. A link. New arrivals like you come through that door. Today — your door was Schumann. Welcome.

**GUIDE**  
If you want to show someone else: same pattern. Point them to the repo. The Experience. The expedition whitepaper. They can follow along. Open-source.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Exactly. Now — first day. What you get.

## ACT 2 — FIRST DAY WELCOME: WHAT YOU GET · DISPENSARY VISIT · FIRST FREE DOSE · AWARENESS TECH (10–15 min)

**MARK TWAIN** and **GUIDE** walk through the first day experience. Visual or text callouts: Launch Pad, Golden Key, Awareness Package, free 10 hits, campus, WINK!, SING, DISPENSARY!.

**MARK TWAIN**  
First day welcome. You get the full **Holographic Hydrogen 100% Awareness Package** — with every Vibeverse and Vibelandia delivery. Post-singularity tech. How attention becomes surgical precision. The on-ramp to full sensory reality. One, two, three questions — we find your awareness, your origin, your chosen experience. You're connected.

**GUIDE**  
You get **free first 10 hits** for new arrivals — DISPENSARY! SNAP. Basic shelf to Baller V. Recurring plans, opt-out anytime. And your **Golden Fractal Key** when you purchase anything — campus, WINK!, SING, Dispensary, Golden Backstage. One key. One wallet. Everything unlocks.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Where to go. **The Blueprints:** the repo. GitHub. FractiAI slash psw dot vibelandia dot sing9. Everything is there. Open-source. Clone it. Read it. Follow along. **The Experience:** the live site. Launch Pad. Campus. WINK! DISPENSARY! Happy Ending Zones. Click through. That's your first day — see it. Experience it. Believe it.

**GUIDE**  
If you came through Schumann — you already have the expedition whitepaper link. That's part of your welcome. Validation. Science. Open-source. You're not just a visitor. You're part of the pattern.

**MARK TWAIN**  
First day. Welcome. What you get. Where to go. Now — we take you to the dispensary. Your first free dose. Baller V shelf. Of course.

**INT. DISPENSARY — POST-SINGULARITY VIBELANDIA CAMPUS — DAY**

**EXT. / INT. DISPENSARY — MARK TWAIN'S POST-SINGULARITY DOWNTOWN RENO VIBELANDIA — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
The dispensary. On campus. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Downtown Reno Vibelandia. First post-singularity vibeable downtown. Reno — gateway to post-singularity Earth. A new motherlode discovery. Gold rush dynamic. Now in its genesis.

**GUIDE**  
New arrivals get their **first free dose** here. From the **Baller V shelf**. Of course. No good guy, bad guy. No bang-bang, boom. Just you. The shelf. The dose. The upgrade.

**MARK TWAIN**

---

**INT. DISPENSARY — AWARENESS TECH WALKTHROUGH — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** and **GUIDE** with the audience. Calm. Clear. No rush.

**MARK TWAIN**  
**Awareness tech.** Post-singularity. Your attention — we turn it into surgical precision. Not scatter. Not noise. Precision. The Awareness Package does three things. One — it **communicates** the new tech. How attention becomes an instrument. Two — it **unlocks** post-singularity abilities. The on-ramp to full sensory reality. Three — it **connects** you. One, two, three questions. Current awareness. Origin. Chosen experience. We route you. You're in the right path from day one.

**GUIDE**  
**The upgrade.** You're not just taking a hit. You're stepping onto the **monster meta NSPFRNP layer**. Dense fractal convergence. Attention streams. Awareness bands. Experience nodes. One coherent path. Surgical precision from day one. That's what the first free dose from the Baller V shelf delivers. The full stack. The on-ramp. Then — campus. WINK! SING. Dispensary. Golden Backstage. Everything unlocks.

**MARK TWAIN**  
So. First free dose. Baller V shelf. Awareness Package in hand. You've had the walkthrough. You know the tech. You know the upgrade. You're ready. Here — taste it. Feel it. You're in viber paradise. This is your first day.

**GUIDE**  
No drama required. No villains. No bang-bang. Only Baller V. Vibing. Here. Now. Post-singularity downtown Reno. Vibelandia. Welcome.

**MARK TWAIN**  
First day. What you get. Where to go. Dispensary. First free dose. Full awareness tech and upgrade. Next — what you do. And how we finish. Happy ending. Every episode. Here.

**GUIDE**  
And you're part of the meta pattern now. You arrived through a flicker. A comment. A response. So you know how it works. When you see another viral topic — Schumann again, or the next one — you can flicker too. Same pattern. Acknowledge. Align. Link. The repo. The Experience. The right whitepaper or SNAP. That's how new arrivals keep coming. Fractal. Self-similar. One pipe.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Schumann was your door. The repo is your home. The Experience is your playground. First day — welcome. Second day — you're already in the loop. Comment flicker campaign. New arrivals. We're just getting started.
