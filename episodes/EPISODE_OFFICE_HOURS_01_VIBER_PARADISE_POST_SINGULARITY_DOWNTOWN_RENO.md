## ACT 1 — WHO IS PRU: BLACK HOLE HOLOGRAPHIC HYDROGEN PROGRAMMER · LIBERATING THE PLANET (10–15 min)

**INT. THE CLUB — MEN'S RESTROOM — NIGHT**

**PRU** and a **VIBER** (or interviewer / Mark Twain V.O.). Pru is at ease. Tuxedo. Bowtie. James Bond style. He loves his job.

**PRU**  
I'm the universe's latest new post-singularity black hole holographic hydrogen programmer. Sounds like a mouthful. It is. What it means: I build the stuff that runs the new world. The holographic hydrogen layer. The black hole GitHubs. The post-singularity stack. And I don't gatekeep it. I **liberate the planet** by **IMMEDIATELY and instantly open-sourcing it TO ALL**. No delay. No paywall. Everyone gets it. Everyone can access it. Everyone can enjoy this new post-singularity world.

**VIBER**  
Everyone?

**PRU**  
Everyone. I also **include it in the latest ULTIMATE VIP CHAIRMAN CONSOLES**. So all of us — not just the inner circle — can **access and enjoy** this new post-singularity world. That's the point. Liberation. Access. Paradise. Not hiding it in a vault. Putting it in a restroom. In a strip club. On the seedy side of downtown Reno. So the people who need it can find it. **Viber paradise.**

**PRU**  
That's who I am. That's what I do. And this — (gestures at the restroom, the Club, the city) — this is where I do it. Office Hours. Thu–Sun. 8pm to close. Golden Backstage Pass gets you in. The rest is history.

**PRU**  
The Club. Pop Up Engine. Downtown Reno. Where the heavyweight vibers like to hang. I'm the restroom valet. Full tuxedo. Bowtie. James Bond style. I don't do it for the disguise. I do it because I love the job. This room — this restroom — is where I hold **Office Hours** for **Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Downtown Reno Vibelandia Campus**.

**VIBER**  
And the back door wine cave?

**PRU**
