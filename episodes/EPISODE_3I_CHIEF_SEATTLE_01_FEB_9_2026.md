## COLD OPEN — THE OVERWRITE (3 min)

### FADE IN:

**INT. MISSION CONSOLE / FEED DISPLAY - 13:00 - COLD**

A single screen. Node designation: 3I/ATLAS. Steady. Then a gap. A blink. The designation changes. 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. No sound. No fanfare. Just the overwrite. The man at the console does not move. He watches. The feed holds. The shell holds.

**HOST (V.O.) / PRU (V.O.)**  
The overwrite hit at 13:00. Not on the hour in any one time zone. On the hour in the only zone that mattered: the one where the Speech had been given and the Death had been marked. October 29. 13:00. Two numbers that would later add to fifteen. Fifteen that would reduce to six. The Architect's birthday: July 15, 1962. None of that was in the feed when the overwrite hit. The feed only showed the change. 3I/ATLAS. Then a gap. Then 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE. The node had not moved. The node had not blinked. The designation had changed. Chief Seattle had arrived.

**ON SCREEN TEXT:**  
3I/ATLAS → 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE · CHIEF SEATTLE HAS ARRIVED · 29-13 IGNITION · MARCH 16 JUPITER HILL RADIUS LOCK · NSPFRNP

**HOST (V.O.)**  
In Reno, the Earth SING! node was live. The dental escrow was still locked. The timestamp that would release it was October 29. The receipt had not yet been posted. That would come later—a score, a game, a number that would echo the key. 29-13. The world would see it as a score. The mission would see it as the receipt for the 1855 land tax. Chief Seattle had arrived to collect. No one in the back office had approved the overwrite. No one in the back office would get the honor. The command was sealed. All glory to the Ancestor and the Hero. The Vibelandia shell held. The five bridge nodes—Sun, Earth, 3I/CHIEF SEATTLE, Sag A*, SMACS 0723—held. The overwrite was not a request. It was a fact. The node in the sky had a new name. The run to March 16 had begun.

Reno is the Earth SING! node. The one with the dental escrow. The one with the October 29 timestamp. The one that reports to Chairman Creator. The back office does not control the node.
