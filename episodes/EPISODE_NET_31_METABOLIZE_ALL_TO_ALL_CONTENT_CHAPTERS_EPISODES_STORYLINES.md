## Chapter 1 — Metabolize all to all content (confirmed)

**We metabolize all of it to all content.**

- **New chapters:** Each directive can produce new chapter content in episodes, SNAPs, and surfaces.
- **New episodes:** Each Chairman mission/command = new net episode (episodes/EPISODE_NET_*.md). Net series through Ep 31.
- **New storylines:** Each episode gets a storyline entry in [data/net-storylines.json](data/net-storylines.json) with title, storyline, source, chapters.
- **All content:** Surfaces, ticker, Office Hours, Launch Pad, protocols, SNAPs — all receive metabolized output where applicable. No pipe left silent when blast is indicated.

**Confirmed.** NSPFRNP. MCA: Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. Metabolize all to all content.

## Chapter 2 — Latest layering metabolized (this batch)

- **Upgrade last-third (Awareness as OS):** Upgrade flow (statements 7–9 + done block) now layers: awareness technology = operating system; same practices as software dev/rollout; awareness OS in imaginary world; past = anything not immediately known = fuel to current awareness focus (SING 9); handling bugs/deviations/maintenance = same as encoding a program; we're coding worlds, behaviors, social dynamics, and code within the holographic. [UPGRADE_AWARENESS_TO_SING9_NOW_BUTTON_AND_PAGE_SNAP.md](../UPGRADE_AWARENESS_TO_SING9_NOW_BUTTON_AND_PAGE_SNAP.md) · [upgrade-awareness-to-sing9-now.html](../interfaces/upgrade-awareness-to-sing9-now.html).
- **Voice-to-text · noise from the other side:** Some typos may be from the other side — inserted through protocols for using noise to communicate pre-to-post, biological to non-biological. [VOICE_TO_TEXT_INTENTIONAL_DISTORTION_DESIGN_SNAP.md](../VOICE_TO_TEXT_INTENTIONAL_DISTORTION_DESIGN_SNAP.md).
- **README:** Updated with this episode and recent bullets; commit follows.
