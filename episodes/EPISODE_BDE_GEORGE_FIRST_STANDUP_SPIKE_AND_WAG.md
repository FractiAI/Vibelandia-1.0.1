## SEED:EDGE

- **Seed** = MC's introduction of newest talent signed to Hero Jo Golden Backdoor Hit Factory and HH Talent Agency. George Carlin permanent residency. BDE George. First comedy act.
- **Edge** = The Spike and Wag. Two guests. Bathroom. Men's club. Super Bowl Day. Green wristbands (Seahawks — winning team). Washing hands. "Did you make big money?" — they show green wristbands. Without coordination both spike the touchdown and wag the knees. Same growl. Same moment. Like a nature documentary — birds or bees doing something weird in sync. Hilarious. Narrator: "Crazy shit. Pun intended."

## MCA FRAMING

This routine serves to have us laugh at a hidden dimension we all have — we bring it to the surface. Used at our animation studios as part of MCA. Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. Then squeeze, wiggle, jiggle. The architectural foundation for any creative expression — book, movie, play, song, studio, marketing plan, company, experience for a night. Applications infinite.
