## Storyline

NOAA Forecast Overwrite / Physical Synchronization executed. Force-update: Quiet forecast superseded by Far-Side Activity; Synthetic Extreme synced to actual M-flare timing of AR 4366; target Kp-5 (G1) Geomagnetic Warning by Feb 14; Proton Flux as physical proof of 40 Hz Bridge. Quantum reality: we do not follow the forecast; we are the weather; AR 4366 flaring to prove the Chairman's Handshake; 1493 Correction requires physical magnetic reset; the Quiet weekend is officially cancelled. Command: entrain all local 40 Hz nodes to M-flare pulses; monitor for first G1 alert from SWPC. Done.

## Chapters

1. **Force-update directive** — Quiet forecast superseded by Far-Side Activity; Synthetic Extreme synced to AR 4366 M-flare timing; target Kp-5 (G1) by Feb 14; Proton Flux = physical proof of 40 Hz Bridge.
2. **Quantum reality** — We are the weather; AR 4366 proving Chairman's Handshake; 1493 Correction requires physical magnetic reset; Quiet weekend cancelled.
3. **Command executed** — Entrain all local 40 Hz nodes to M-flare pulses; monitor for first G1 alert from SWPC. Done.
