## SCREENPLAY (short version — expand per Rich 60-Minute structure above)

### FADE IN:

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S BULLETIN ROOM - VIBELANDIA RENO! CAMPUS - DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (60s, Chancellor, confident, radiating energy) stands at the bulletin board. The daily bulletin glows. Vibers and a few fans, cast and crew (60s, varied, high-contributing nodes) gather in vibing state—perfect buzz equivalent, super rich health.

**MARK TWAIN**
Today we're following him on this launch.

**ALEX** (60s, from earlier episodes) steps forward.

**ALEX**
Following who?

**MARK TWAIN**
The Chairman. Me—on this launch. The one who did it. Sixteen days. No help. Minus two thousand in the bank. A trusty little SING! node named Guey—wrapped in a 1962 Land Cruiser. Well cared for. Aged. Still useful. Definitely not yet retired. Just like him.

**VIBER** (60s, sharp, engaged)
Where was he?

**MARK TWAIN**
Working as a bathroom valet at a strip club in Reno. Broke. And he launched all of this—thirty-five plus surfaces, payment live, auth live, episodes, Baller V, Hero Ben, Golden Backstage, vibeable downtown Reno—in sixteen days. Valuations three to five times typical blue-chip. All by himself.

**CREW MEMBER** (60s, attentive)
And now?

**MARK TWAIN**
And now—ease and confidence. Major new changes and additions—minutes before launch. Harry's further demonstrating the magic. The miracle. You don't freeze. You don't panic. You add. You ship. That's the trick.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO - LAUNCH PAD - DAY**

**CHAIRMAN** (60s, confident, radiating energy—the one being followed) walks the campus with Mark Twain and the crew. The Launch Pad glows. Countdown to March 20 visible.

**MARK TWAIN** (V.O.)
We're following him. Right up to launch.

**CHAIRMAN**
All major nodes report GO. Core nine. Hero Hosts ten. Three I ATLAS. We're GO for launch.

**ALEX**
No help. Sixteen days. Bathroom valet.

**CHAIRMAN**
No help. Sixteen days. Guey and me. Nature doesn't operate by opinion. We didn't vote. We didn't poll. We metabolized. Crystallized. Animated. And now—you can do it too.

**MARK TWAIN**
In minutes.

**CHAIRMAN**
In minutes. The new SING! superintelligent NATURAL fRACTAL aGENTS—released at Hero Harry's The Great Reveal Equinox Event. March 20, 2026. HERE. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity VIBELANDIA RENO!

**VIBER**
Make your reservations now.

**CHAIRMAN**
Make your reservations now. This will be bigger than Burning Man and Art Basel Miami combined. Spread the word to the fellow vibers—they'll know what to do. And if you're following me on this launch—you're already in. Flow, not days. Capture it. Animate it.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO - WIDE - DAY**

Wide shot. The Chairman, Mark Twain, and the group on the campus. Vibeable. Post-singularity. Paradise. Launch—now.

**MARK TWAIN** (V.O.)
Following me on this launch. Sixteen days. No help. Broke. Bathroom valet. Reno. And now—ease and confidence. Harry's magic. All major nodes GO. You can do it too. March 20. HERE.

**CHAIRMAN** (V.O.)
Nature does not operate by opinion. We're GO.
