## Logline

A domestic beat turns into confrontation: a run to Western Union, a wrong decision, and the refrain that won't stop—*I thought you knew.*

4. **Loop.** *I thought you knew* — repeated. Guilt, deflection, or genuine belief.
5. **Arrival / escalation.** *She's getting her.* *Sorry. Sorry.* Violence implied. *It's coming a lot.*
